(2019 – 2022) 

Office of the National Security Council

Office of the Prime Minister

Foreword

National  security  is  a  vital  foundation  for  the  nation’s  progress,  prosperity,  resilience  against  
problems and effective preparedness. For this reason, the Cabinet passed a resolution on 3 September 2019 
to approve the National Security Policy and Plan (2019-2022) proposed by the Office of the National 
Security Council as the principal framework for the prevention, warning, resolution or suppression of threats 
and for the maintaining of national security. The National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022) were 
prepared through the collaboration of various sectors in providing opinions, suggestions, strategic goals, 
indicators and strategies for all aspects of national security. It also includes the assessment and analyses 
of future security trends within the internal and external security contexts, study of the National Strategy, 
the National Reform Plan and the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017 – 2022), 
the National Strategy’s Master Plan, the policies/strategies of relevant ministries and allocated budgets.    

According to the Cabinet resolution on Guidelines for the submission of the Cabinet’s consideration, 
passed on 4 December 2017, the National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022) is considered 
a second-level plan devised to support the National Strategy, which is the first-level plan. In implementing 
the National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022), relevant state agencies will formulate their own 
strategies, plans or projects corresponding to the National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022) or 
the national security operation plans or collaborative projects to achieve maximum security benefits 
and national interests. The Office of the National Security Council shall act as the key monitoring agency 
for these operations. 

To be successful, all sectors must join forces in collaborative and integrative implementation of 
the National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022) to achieve the tangible outcomes of national security, 
prosperity and sustainability.

The National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)

Part 1 : Introduction

1.1 Principles and rationale 

Whereas Section 52 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, B.E. 2560 (2017) 
stipulates that the State shall protect and uphold the monarchical institution, independence, sovereignty, 
integrity  of  the  territories  and  the  areas  over  which  Thailand  has  the  sovereignty  rights,  honor 
and  interest  of  the  Nation,  security  of  the  State,  and  public  order.  Hence,  for  these  purposes,  
the State shall provide efficient military, diplomatic, and intelligence services for the purpose of national 
development, in conjunction with Section 13 of the National Security Council Act, B.E. 2559 (2016) 
which stipulates that the Cabinet shall have the National Security Policy and Plan established, with 
the National Security Council’s recommendation, the Office of the National Security Council hereby 
formulates the present National Security Policy and Plan.

The formulation of the said National Security Policy and Plan shall be in accordance with 
Section 14 of the National Security Council Act, B.E. 2559 (2016) which stipulates that the National 
Security Policy and Plan must coherently  address domestic and foreign policies as well as military, 
economic and other national security policies to ensure close collaboration among state agencies 
for constructive national security, and they must at least specify the national security goals and 
implementation guidelines for the following issues: 1) To strengthen the security of the nation’s key  
institutions and the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of State; 2) To protect and  
uphold  national  interests;  3)  To  promote  the  national  preparedness  system  and  national  defense  
capability; and 4) To maintain national and international security. Formulation of the National Security 
Policy and Plan shall also be in accordance with Section 5 Paragraph Three of the National Strategy 
Preparation Act, B.E. 2560 (2017) which stipulates that the Cabinet shall determine its policies on the 
administration of state affairs before assuming the administration of state affairs, and the preparation of 
the National Economic and Social Development Plan, the National Security Policy and Plan and any other 
plans, including the preparation of annual appropriations must be consistent with the National Strategy. 

Upon the royal promulgation enacting the National Security Policy and Plan, the Cabinet or 
state agencies must adopt them as the frameworks or guidelines for the execution of their powers and 
duties in preparing the state affairs administrative plans, legislative plans, specific strategies and security 
plans, the national preparedness plan, the crisis management plans related to the national security or 
plans/projects related to the National Security Policy and Plan or any other operation that are in line with 
the National Security Policy and Plan.

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)1.2 Preparation process

Section 21(2) of the National Security Council Act, B.E. 2559 (2016) stipulates that the Office 
of the National Security Council shall prepare drafts of the National Security Policy and Plan in compliance  
with the goals and guidelines prescribed by the National Security Council for submission to the Council 
together with Section 13 Paragraph Two which stipulates that in formulating the National Security Policy 
and Plan, the Council shall organize hearings to solicit opinions from relevant state agencies and 
the public.

The Office of the National Security Council subsequently submitted drafts of the National 
Security Policy and Plan to the National Strategy Committee for consideration pursuant to Section 5  
Paragraph Three of the National Strategy Preparation Act, B. E. 2560 (2017) and the Cabinet resolution, 
passed on 4 December 2017, regarding guidelines for Cabinet submission of plans. The drafts National 
Security Policy and Plan were then submitted to the Cabinet for approval.  

The Office of the National Security Council also complied with Section 13 Paragraph Three 
of the National Security Council Act, B.E. 2559 (2016) which stipulates that announcement and revision of 
the National Security and Plan shall be issued as a royal command to be promulgated in the Government 
Gazette.

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022) 
Part 2 : Security situations and contexts (2019 - 2022)

2.1 Shifting global security contexts    

2.1.1 International politics: There is a trend toward a multipolar system of global politics in 
which Russia and China are challenging the United States’ influence. However, the cooperation between 
the United States, Japan, Australia and India under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) framework 
will strengthen the United States’ roles as the forerunner of Asian security. In addition, the impacts of 
emerging powers on the global economy, especially the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and 
South Africa, have significantly increased in the international arenas, with the intention of becoming more 
involved in determining the regulatory framework for the global economy. These major shifts in the global 
economy and international finance toward a new balance of power pose challenges to the existing world 
order both in terms of world politics and economy. Such development forces Thailand to adopt more 
flexible international policies to maintain its international relations balance with the superpowers. 
Moreover, the world is also facing the important global issues of energy, natural resource and environmental 
security as well as natural disasters, especially the search for new energy sources which may lead to 
international conflicts. At the same time, other environmental issues such as climate change also have 
direct impacts on the occurrence of severe natural disasters. International cooperation to address global  
environmental problems is, therefore, imperative and tends to result in more interventions by the superpowers 
in the forms of new international relations regulations which can be used as an excuse for the introduction 
of new trade protectionist measures. 

2.1.2 Possession of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction: The expansion 
of the sphere of influence and the development of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction 
capability by many countries are the contributing factors to international tension and distrust. It also 
leads to the rise in the smuggling of material/equipment for the production of weapons and the terrorist  
groups’  use  of  production  technology  and  R&D  data  to  develop  more  destructive  weapons.  Such  
developments are major concerns that require more international cooperation to address the issues. There 
have been efforts by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to press the international community  
into implementing the following measures: 1) To raise awareness of the importance of nuclear security at 
the state level; 2) To have countries preparing action plans to address nuclear and radioactive threats; 3) 
To encourage data sharing and collaboration between state agencies of countries with adjacent borders; 
and 4) To support the organizing of trainings in detection of nuclear and radioactive materials smuggling. 

2.2 Shifting regional security contexts     

2.2.1 Increasing influences and roles of the superpowers in Southeast Asian region: 
There  have  been  policy  shifts  among  the  superpowers  that  indicate  a  tendency  toward  increasing  
competition and expansion of their influence, both military and economic, for their national interest. 
The competition is especially fierce between the United States and China as both countries try to secure  
alliance  from  small  and  medium  -  sized  countries.  While  the  United  States  follows  the  Indo-Pacific  

3

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)Strategy, China adopts the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Strategy with the goals of securing economic, 
trade, investment and the inter-regional infrastructures connecting Asia, Africa and Europe. To achieve 
these goals, China tries hard to extend its political and diplomatic influences over ASEAN countries which 
resulted  in  more  regional  conflicts.  However,  the  region’s  current  forms  of  interception-engagement, 
blockage and collaborative relations with the superpowers have forced small and medium - sized countries 
to be more cautious in maintaining a balance in their relations with the superpowers. Nevertheless, Thailand’s 
geographical advantages can be utilized to advance her economic policies among other countries in the 
region, especially the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) policy that can be linked to China’s BRI policy and 
the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT – GT) policy.

2.2.2 Expansion of regional international relations: ASEAN countries are rapidly moving 
toward more “political, security, economic and social integration and cohesiveness” under the ASEAN 
Community Visions 2025. This vision will result in the strengthening of political and economic cooperation 
among ASEAN member countries through regional transportation routes. Nevertheless, challenges to the 
ASEAN Community come from their diverse political and economic systems. The promotion of the sense 
of community and open interaction among member countries, especially on the issue of free population 
movement within the region, can create security risks for ASEAN member countries. Such risks include 
the rise of transnational crimes, black economy, drug and human trafficking problems. In addition, ASEAN 
is still facing the challenge of how to maintain national security while engaging with the superpowers, 
including the South China Sea conflicts among several ASEAN member countries.     

Nevertheless, the relations among ASEAN member countries are relatively unified with no 
tendency toward any internal discord. At present, ASEAN is striving toward becoming a perfect community  
and aims to achieve more cooperation and unity.  

2.2.3 Territorial conflicts and the use of military forces: Thailand has positive relations 
with the neighboring countries with no border conflicts that require the use of military forces. Although 
there are still some misunderstandings and distrust which may lead to conflicts, the degree of violence 
caused by such problems are localized due to the close relations and cooperation that exist at all levels 
as well as the strong preventive diplomacy and positive cooperation within the region and the ASEAN 
Community. However, based on the existing regional conflicts together with the internal situations of 
Thailand’s neighboring countries, the roles that the superpowers play within the region and the 
territorial disputes, both land and sea, that Thailand has with several neighboring countries, the risk of 
military dispute in the region still remains. This fact is apparent from the increased military budgets of 
many countries in the region. Escalation of conflicts and lack of mutual cooperation to efficiently deal 
with the problem can lead to the use of military forces. 

2.2.4 Maritime security and interests: Thailand’s maritime interest is highly valuable due 
to its geopolitical importance, strategic location on the regional maritime route and abundant maritime 
natural resources. These factors are the reasons why the superpowers have keen interests in maintaining 

4

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)and expanding their influence in the region. Major threats to the region’s maritime security are: maritime  
territorial dispute, competition for maritime interests, uncertainty over the South China Sea, maritime 
terrorism,  man-made  environmental  degradation,  enforcement  of  maritime  laws,  maritime  industrial 
problems, maritime smuggling of goods, materials and instruments with potential for the production of 
weapons of mass destruction, drugs and military weapons, illegal migration, piracy, maritime disaster and 
natural disaster that may have impacts on the risk to the maintaining of the balance of maritime security 
and interests.

The overall maritime security of Thailand is still normal and suitable for tourism and 
international trade. However, Thailand is still facing the problem of encroachment on its maritime rights 
due to its abundant maritime resources and the consequential impacts of the region’s current maritime 
security situations. 

2.3 Shifting domestic security contexts   

2.3.1  Security  of  the  monarchical  institution:  The  monarchy  shall  continue  to  play 
important roles as one of the key institutions of the Thai society. However, domestic and international 
political movements also continue to undermine the monarchy for their own benefits by making fault 
claims to smear and cause misunderstanding of the monarchical institution. These are sensitive issues 
that can cause conflicts among various groups within the Thai society. The close connection that the 
Thais have with their kings are continually weakened, especially among the Thai youth, due to their lack 
of understanding and recognition of the important roles of the institution as the focal point of the Thai 
society’s morale and unity.

2.3.2. Internal conflicts: Thailand’s political development is moving toward the political 
culture that demands more people participation in the decision-making process of government policies, 
especially the policies relating to the distribution of wealth and the management of key natural resources. 
They are expressed through the people’s demand for political rights and civil liberty through the election 
process and the rights to protect their own interest or the local community’s rights. While Thailand is 
experiencing major changes in its economic, social and political structures it is also facing structural  
problems  caused  by  inherent  economic  and  social  inequality,  unequal  access  to  natural  resources, 
corruption, injustice, inefficient public administration and different points of view of different groups of 
people. These are the push factors that lead to disparity of ideas between different groups of people 
which have become more apparent in recent years and resulted in violent political conflicts of increasingly  
complex  nature.  People  tend  to  have  lower  level  of  tolerance  and  political  conflicts  have  become  
a sensitive issue that pose a threat to the unity and immunity of the Thai society. However, there are no 
signs that in the near future political risks will escalate into the serious threats or political conflicts of the 
past periods. This is because the Thai people still want to maintain peace and social order. Key factors 
for the creation of social unity are: reduction of social inequality, equal access to the judicial process, 
human rights protection, elimination of corruption, promotion of democracy and people’s participation 
in politics. 

5

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)2.3.3 Situations in the Southern Border Provinces:  Conflict in the Southern Border 
Provinces are highly complex, sensitive and multi-faceted issues caused by religious ideology, cultural 
and historical factors as well as injustice in the areas. The violent perpetrators with separatism 
ideology use the differences in religions and ethnic identities to justify their use of violence. The situations 
are further exacerbated by the problems of narcotics, complicate threats, the civil sector’s influence, 
youth groups with different views from the State recruited to join their violent campaigns, international  
organization’s roles and interventions as well as illegal trade and smuggling of goods. Situations in the 
Southern Border Provinces are improving with the introduction of the government policies to win the 
trust of local people and to promote tangible recognition and acceptance of a multicultural society.

2.3.4 Lack of confidence in governmental administration under the rule of law: 
Thailand is still facing structural problems that are not conducive to public administration under the 
rule of law, the lack of confidence in the leaders as well as the relatively centralized political 
and administrative structures that limit participation by other sectors in the society. Heightened levels 
of public corruption have resulted in people’s distrust of the government while some people still find it 
acceptable. Public corruption undermines the moral and ethical foundations of the Thai society.

2.3.5 Drug problems: Drug problems continue to be one of the social problems that will 
continue to exist despite the level of national development. This problem is most serious among the 
vulnerable youth and children. Other drug-related problems are: crime, an increase in organized crime,  
uneven  development,  poverty,  etc.  The  geographical  location  of  Thailand  makes  its  Northern  and  
Northeastern borders vulnerable to transnational drug trafficking. The unique and constantly changing 
patterns of drug trafficking method and organization make it more difficult to prevent and suppress drug 
trafficking.  

2.3.6 Natural disaster risks: Changing global weather patterns and global warming have 
become more severe with an increase in the world population.  Moreover, economic-growth-oriented 
development also resulted in unregulated use of natural resources which created environment degradation 
and negative impacts on the ecosystem. Such changes have led to more frequent and severe natural 
disasters with more areas that are at risk of floods, storms, droughts, flash floods, landslides, tsunamis, 
coastal erosion, sinkholes and earthquakes. Floods and droughts, which have become increasingly more 
frequent and severe, are the two main disasters Thailand is facing. It is, therefore, necessary for Thailand 
to develop the capability, knowledge, skills, experiences and preparedness for efficient crisis and disaster 
management as well as the prevention, resolving and rehabilitation of the impacts of more severe crisis 
and natural disasters. There must also be more cooperation with the international community in the 
management of such disasters.

2.4 Shifting transborder security contexts     

2.4.1 Shifting transnational threats:  Transnational threats have rapidly and extensively 
increased with the emergence of globalization that affects the economy, politics, social systems and the 

6

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)national security of Thailand, especially the rise of terrorism and transnational crime. The driving force 
behind Thailand’s terrorism threats is the compelling ideological conflicts that turn believers into various 
forms of terrorism from lone-actor to small cell terrorist. Major factors for terrorism are: economic, social 
and political injustice, ethnic and culture identity problems and religious ideology. International terrorist 
groups with no clear command structure are spreading their activities across the world and are leaning 
more toward urban terrorism.  

International  terrorist  groups  are  also  active  in  Southeast  Asia,  spreading  violent  
ideologies and recruiting new followers. In Southeast Asia, terrorist attacks are carried out both by local 
terrorist groups that are inspired by international terrorist groups, and international terrorist groups that 
penetrate into this region by exploiting the vulnerability of countries’ border security measures as well 
as using the Internet and social media communication to spread their ideologies. The primary target of 
these terrorist activities is the civilians while the secondary target group are government officials, police 
officers, soldiers, religious minority and other groups. Terrorist attacks can be either the bombing of the 
infrastructures or cyberattack. Although Thailand is not a direct target of international terrorist group,  
it is still essential to monitor possible terrorism risk, especially the risk of Thailand being used as a place 
of refuge and base for terrorist attack both within and outside the region as well as for urban terrorism.

Thailand  is  the  key  target  for  the  transnational  crimes  of  drug,  human  and  arms  
trafficking,  money  laundering,  piracy,  economic  crime,  passport  fraud  trade  as  well  as  cybercrime.  
All countries regard cybercrime as their top priority and cyberattack is likely to become an integral part 
of future warfare. There is also a tendency for cybercrime to quickly expand and become difficult to 
control. The forms and techniques of cybercrime will become more advanced with the rapid progress of 
science and technology. At the same time, cybercrime law enforcement is still lacking, making it more 
convenient to commit cybercrime with the help of stronger organized crime network and state officials’ 
involvement.  The  connection  between  terrorism  and  transnational  crime  tend  to  increase  with  less  
travelling restriction, the expanding tourism industry as well as the spread of violence ideologies and 
collaboration of groups with similar ideologies. Integrated security cooperation in ASEAN has been slow 
due to the different levels of law enforcement efficiency of each member countries. 

2.4.2 Population movement: Population movement from neighboring countries into Thailand  
is mostly illegal and causes subsequent problems of how to discourage travelling and return them to 
their country. A large number of illegal migrants still find ways to remain in Thailand and causes international  
political problems, especially in the case of illegal migrants who have conflict with their own government. 
The  main  reasons  for  such  migration  are  political;  internal  conflict  in  home  country;  and  economic;  
different levels of economic development and quality of life. Thailand’s increasing needs for foreign labor 
came with other problems such as health care, legal status and rights, education, conflict with Thai  
communities, human trafficking and other crimes, including Thailand’s long-term economic competitiveness. 
In addition, there is a tendency for migrants to use Thailand as a transit point to enter another country. 

7

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)This is due to Thailand’s geographical location sharing borders with several countries. These problems are 
sensitive and have multidimensional impacts on security, human right and international relations. 

2.4.3 Shifting contexts that create new forms of threats: The scope if current security 
threats is quite extensive and complex while having more direct impact on the people. New forms of 
security threats include the threats from changes in global economic, social and political situation, 
including threats from technological development and cyber interconnectivity that link the infrastructure, 
transportation, economic and financial systems together. Other sources of change come from climate 
change and other impacts caused by national development, including unrestricted use of natural resources, 
which result in food and water insecurity, natural resources and environmental degradation as well as 
conflicts in the acquiring of resources, threats from infectious diseases and emerging infectious diseases. 
These threats and risks result in conflicts between the people and state agencies. In addition, an increase 
in global energy needs affects Thailand’s energy security in term of its competition with other countries 
in the search for new energy sources, especially as Thailand now has to rely primarily on energy from 
foreign countries.

National Security Policy and Plan (2019 – 2022)Part 3 : National Security Policy and Plan   

3.1 Conceptual framework  

3.1.1 Framework 1 – Legal provisions   

The  Constitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand,  B.E.  2560  (2017):  Article  52  of  
the  Constitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand  stipulates  that  the  State  shall  protect  and  uphold  the  
monarchical institution, independence, sovereignty, integrity of the territories and the areas over which 
Thailand has the sovereignty rights, honor and interest of the Nation, security of the State, and public 
order. For these purposes, the State shall provide efficient military, diplomatic, and intelligence services. 
The armed forces shall also be deployed for the purpose of national development. 

The National Security Council Act, B.E. 2559 (2016) Section 13 of this Act stipulates 
that the National Security Policy and Plan shall be established as the principal framework or direction for 
the protection, warning, resolution or suppression of threats and the safeguarding of national security.

The National Strategy Preparation Act, B.E. 2560 (2017) Section 5 of this Act stipulates 
that the National Strategy shall be established with the goals of promoting sustainable national development 
in accordance with the principle of good governance and the framework for the preparation of consistent 
and integrated plans to constitute a driving force towards such goals, within the period of time set out in 
the National Strategy which must not be less than twenty years. 

The National Strategy shall be promulgated by a Royal Command and shall come 
into  force  upon  its  publication  in  the  Government  Gazette,  and  all  State  agencies  have  the  duty  of  
implementing them for the purpose of achieving the goals set out therein. 

Determination of policies on the administration of State affairs by the Cabinet before 
assuming the administration of State affairs, preparation of the National Economic and Social Development 
Plan, the National Security Policy and Plan and any other plans, including the preparation of the annual 
appropriations shall be made in consistency with the National Strategy.

3.1.2 Framework 2 – Adopting the King’s Philosophies as the principles for security  
operation:  These  philosophies  are,  for  example,  the  “Understanding,  Reaching  out  and  Developing” 
strategy,  the  Sufficiency  Economy  Philosophy  and  the  New  Agriculture  Theory  as  the  principles  for  
security operation.

3.1.3  Framework  3  –  The  importance  of  comprehensive  security:  This  framework  
recognizes the importance of various dimensions such as human security, freedom from fear, freedom
