Australia’s AI Action PlanMINISTER’S FOREWORD

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents incredible opportunities to grow our economy, 
create jobs, stimulate businesses, and by doing so, can also improve our day to day 
lives. Australians are already using AI every day. We’re organising our daily schedules 
using voice assistants and taking recommendations on the movies we should watch. 
AI helps our manufacturers create new and better products. It helps predict and 
prevent the spread of bushfires. It also helps speed up our ability to diagnose and 
treat diseases such as COVID-19. 

It has been estimated that AI could contribute more than $20 trillion dollars to the global economy 
by 2030. To take advantage of the opportunities AI presents, it is vital that as a nation we harness 
our collective capabilities, talent and resources to be both early adopters of AI, but also significant 
contributors to the progress of this technology. 

Australia’s AI Action Plan sets out the Australian Government’s path forward to ensure we responsibly 
leverage AI to further strengthen our economy and lift the quality of life for all Australians. The new 
actions in this plan build on the strong foundations the Australian Government has previously put in 
place to grow our digital and broader economy. 

This plan will ensure AI is used and developed to practically improve our lives, guided by appropriate 
security and ethical considerations. We are committed to ensuring everyone has an opportunity to 
benefit from these new technologies, and that their use and development reflects Australia’s diverse 
community.

As a key part of the Australian Government’s Digital Economy Strategy, the AI Action Plan will support 
businesses to enter new markets, invest in their own digital transformation, and deliver globally 
competitive products and services. 

This will in turn uplift businesses across the economy, boosting their productivity and competitiveness, 
helping them to increase revenue and employ more Australians. To ensure those benefits can be fully 
realised, there is a need for collaboration between our researchers, academics and our industries. For 
that reason, it is important that many of the initiatives being pursued have increasing commercialisation 
as a central principle.

Building our domestic capability in AI also ensures we are well prepared to counter national security 
threats, while simultaneously supporting innovation and developing Australia’s AI expertise in areas of 
competitive strength. For instance, it is clear that AI has great potential and an important part to play in 
Australia’s manufacturing sector and especially for Australia’s 6 National Manufacturing Priorities under 
our Modern Manufacturing Strategy. Whether it is in the areas of resources and critical minerals, medical 
products, or the opportunities of space, we have already seen the enhancements to productivity and 
enterprise that AI brings, and the government is intent on seeing that continue.

The AI Action Plan brings the Australian Government’s direct investment in AI to almost half a billion 
dollars since 2018. The government is committed to elevating Australia to a world leading digital 
economy and a global leader in the development and adoption of AI. 

The Hon Christian Porter MP

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology

Australia’s AI Action PlanSTRATEGIC VISION

Our vision is to establish Australia as a global leader in developing and adopting 
trusted, secure and responsible AI. 

Artificial intelligence is having an impact on how we work, live and play. AI technologies already 
enable our phones and power our online searches. Farmers use AI solutions to inform how to tend to 
their crops. Small businesses use AI to better understand their customers. Builders use it to monitor 
compliance. AI helps us to screen for cancer, detect COVID19 and treat anxiety disorders. On a national 
level, AI is keeping us safe and secure by helping counter national security threats. 

This is just the beginning. We’re in the early stages of a major technological transformation. If Australia 
captures the benefits of this transformation, the opportunities are immense. Innovations driven 
by digital technologies, including AI, could add up to $315 billion to our economy by 2028 (Alpha 
Beta 2018). AI will continue to bolster other digital technologies and elevate human knowledge and 
capability to new levels. New jobs can flow from this growth, with estimates that by 2034, there could 
be 1.2 million new technology jobs realised (Faethm 2020:11). 

Australia is well placed to seize these opportunities and achieve our vision. Australia is already a leader 
in strategic fields of AI like computer vision, deep learning, field robotics, neural networks and machine 
learning. Globally, Australia is a leader in AI research with our academic publications having more 
impact in terms of frequency of citation than research from many other countries (Zhang et al. 2021). 
These strengths provide a solid foundation for an increasingly AI-enabled economy.

Australia also has the right whole-of-economy settings in place. We have the right foundations for 
growing our digital economy. Australia has a competitive, market driven economy with free and open 
trade, strong digital infrastructure and a pipeline of skills that creates the right environment for firms to 
adopt AI as more products come on to market. 

This suite of policies provide support for business adoption of emerging technologies. These broader 
policies, whether specific or more structural, are supporting adoption of emerging technology like AI 
in Australia. 

The new measures announced in the 2021–22 Budget and outlined in this Action Plan build on these 
existing policies by providing targeted assistance to specifically support the adoption and development 
of AI in Australia, to drive a range of desired outcomes.

The time for further action is now. We are not alone in recognising the enormous economic, scientific, 
social, and environmental benefits AI provides, with global investment in AI continuing to increase, and 
the pace of AI product development accelerating. To capture these benefits, the AI Action Plan will 
coordinate the efforts and focus of government, businesses, researchers and the community.

Australia’s AI Action PlanWhat is artificial 
intelligence (AI)? 

AI is a collection of interrelated technologies 
that can be used to solve problems 
autonomously and perform tasks to achieve 
defined objectives. In some cases, it can do 
this without explicit guidance from a human 
being (Hajkowicz et al. 2019:15). AI is more 
than just the mathematical algorithms that 
enable a computer to learn from text, images 
or sounds. It is the ability for a computational 
system to sense its environment, learn, predict 
and take independent action to control virtual 
or physical infrastructure.

Australia’s AI Action PlanAUSTRALIA’S AI ACTION PLAN

The AI Action Plan is a key feature of the Australian Government’s Digital Economy Strategy. 

The Digital Economy Strategy aims to deliver on the Australian Government’s ambition for Australia to 
be a leading digital economy and society by 2030. Building capability in emerging technologies within 
the digital economy, such as AI, will: 

  drive productivity and prosperity

  create jobs

  enable us to solve the real-world problems of today

  grow the businesses and sectors of tomorrow.

The AI Action Plan contributes to this by setting out the Australian Government’s vision for Australia 
to be a global leader in developing and adopting trusted, secure and responsible AI. It outlines the 
actions the government is taking to realise this vision and ensure everyone will share the benefits of 
an AI-enabled economy. Taking these steps will lift our competitive capabilities, enable industry-wide 
transformation and secure Australia’s future prosperity by unlocking local jobs and economic growth.

Australian Government support for AI adoption and development is not new. The AI Action Plan 
represents a focusing of new and existing initiatives and policy settings, and draws together a range of 
actions across government. This includes a combination of: 

  AI direct measures, including those announced in the 2021–22 Budget 

  Programs and incentives that drive the growth of technology and digital skills, where AI can be a 

key or crucial component

  Foundational policy settings that support business, innovation and the Australian economy, where 

the benefit extends to driving the development of AI.

The development of the AI Action Plan complements the work of state and territory governments and 
has drawn on:

  nearly 90 public submissions to the discussion paper

  multiple stakeholder workshops and consultations

  insights from the government’s 2019 national AI summit (Techtonic).

It also aligns with other priority areas of government, including our Modern Manufacturing Strategy. This 
strategy will see Australia be recognised as a high-quality and sustainable manufacturing nation, and 
create jobs for now and future generations. It is also consistent with:

  our commitment to creating a safer online world for Australians through our Cyber Security 

Strategy 2020

  our desire to create a high-skilled workforce for jobs of the future

  the government’s commitment to provide the right incentives to businesses and innovators through 

lower taxes.

Realising the Australian Government’s vision for AI will require governments, businesses, researchers 
and individuals to work together.

Action plan focus areas
The AI Action Plan will be implemented under 4 focus areas. 

  Focus one: Developing and adopting AI to transform Australian businesses – support to help 

businesses develop and adopt AI technologies to create jobs and increase their productivity 
and competitiveness

  Focus two: Creating an environment to grow and attract the world’s best AI talent – support to 

ensure our businesses have access to world-class talent and expertise

  Focus three: Using cutting edge AI technologies to solve Australia’s national challenges – support 
to harness Australia’s world-leading AI research capabilities to solve national challenges, and 
ensure all Australians have an opportunity to benefit from AI

  Focus four: Making Australia a global leader in responsible and inclusive AI – support to ensure 

AI is inclusive and technologies are built to reflect Australian values

 Emergency services

Spark by CSIRO’s Data61

Spark is a toolkit for the end-to-end processing, simulation and analysis of bushfires. The need for a 
flexible and customisable bushfire prediction tool motivated its development. 

Spark uses a hybrid modelling approach to predict how and where 
bushfires might spread. AI plays a key role in this modelling process, 
deriving fuel and vegetation information from remotely sensed data 
sources. It then integrates this with weather data from the Bureau 
of Metrology and physics-based modelling to develop a range of 
simulations. 

It was piloted in the 2019–20 bushfire season to help firefighters on 
the ground, and is now being scaled for nation-wide use (Donnellan 
2021).

 Clean energy 

Synengco

Brisbane-based engineering business, Synengco, built a ‘digital twin’ of an infrastructure, which serves 
as a real-time digital counterpart of the physical infrastructure. This digital twin allows the business 
to model and evaluate the impact of major business decisions. It has deployed this solution to one of 
Australia’s largest power generator to reduce costs and extend asset life.

👁🗨

 IMPACT: 

$8 million fuel savings per year

A digital twin is an exact virtual 
representation, or a virtual clone, of 
a physical asset (such as a building 
or power station). It is designed with 
advanced modelling and analytics 
capabilities, self-learning from the 
actual operation. The digital twin 
monitors the physical asset across its 
lifecycle. It provides real-time data to 
predict and prevent issues or costly 
downtimes and help optimise the 
lifespan of the asset. Image courtesy

 Recycling

Advanced Circular Polymers

Advanced Circular Polymers (ACP) runs Australia’s largest plastic 
recycling facility with a massive capacity of 70,000 tonnes per 
year. The recycling facility sorts the waste plastics using advanced 
AI-enabled robots. ACP is also developing advanced AI-enabled 
autonomous technologies needed for waste sorting, with financial 
support from the Cooperative Research Centres Projects initiative, 
ACP and the University of Melbourne.

Australia’s AI Action Plan Environment 

Healthy Country AI Partnership

The Healthy Country AI partnership in Kakadu National Park is a pioneering program that is mixing 
responsible AI and science with Indigenous knowledge to solve complex environmental management 
problems and care for animal species and habitats. The partnership is part of the Australian 
Government’s National Environmental Science Program through its Northern Australia Environmental 
Resources Hub. It brings together Indigenous Traditional Owners and rangers, CSIRO, Microsoft, Parks 
Australia, the University of Western Australia and Charles Darwin University. 

Under the direction of Indigenous Traditional Owners and rangers, drones capture video footage in 
dual World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park. The data is collected, labelled and interpreted using 
a combination of Indigenous knowledge, Microsoft AI, 
data visualisation and scientific research. The models 
allow rangers to regularly survey large areas that are 
difficult to access and removes the need for people to 
review thousands of hours of video to count animals 
and identify para grass in its different states (burnt, 
wet, growing, dead). Rangers can now rapidly assess 
the impact of reducing para grass weed spread on the 
abundance of culturally-important magpie geese on 
Kakadu’s Nardab floodplain. In 2018, only 50 magpie 
geese were counted. Nine months later, more than 
1,800 have returned to the wetlands. 

The Healthy Country AI partnership represents an end-
to-end solution to support adaptive co-management 
to solve complex environmental problems, create jobs 
and care for significant species and habitats.

👁🗨

 IMPACT: 

using AI to monitor precious habitats

Magpie geese are ‘specialised feeders’ – they eat wild rice, spike rush and two other aquatic plants. But when para grass 
takes over a wetland, it out-competes these plants, leaving less food and less space for the male bird to build the nest.

 Healthcare 

Project Sagasu

Fujitsu Australia, GE Healthcare, Macquarie University and 
Radian Network are collaborating to develop an AI solution to 
detect and monitor brain aneurysms on scans faster and more 
efficiently. The collaboration brings together their individual 
strengths and expertise. The project is refining the technology 
to create a fully commercialised solution. It aims to better equip 
radiologists to make early, potentially life-saving diagnoses and 
improve the quality of life for patients with aneurysms around 
the world.

Australia’s AI Action PlanFOCUS ONE: DEVELOPING AND 
ADOPTING AI TO TRANSFORM 
AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES 

Creating jobs and increasing the 
productivity and competitiveness of 
Australian businesses
We use AI every day in products and services that help us manage businesses, make office work 
productive and increase efficiencies on factory floors and farms. It enables us to introduce incremental 
efficiencies into our routine tasks. But AI can do much more – AI can transform the way we do business 
and lock in our future competitiveness. 

AI technologies are facilitating data-driven business models (Seagate 2018) that enable businesses – 
from local cafés to advanced manufacturers to:

  provide customised products and services

  expand into new industries and markets

  enhance business efficiencies. 

AI is presenting new opportunities for businesses to adopt and use AI technologies to increase their 
productivity and competitiveness, and generate jobs. The Australian Computer Society (ACS) anticipate 
that AI and digital innovation will create up to 1.2 million new ‘technology’ jobs across our economy by 
2034 (Faethm 2020:11). Overall, ACS projects that 5.3 million new jobs may be created by 2034 in the 
Australian economy due to technological advancements (Faethm 2020:10).

While 80% of industry leaders believe that AI will have a transformative impact on their business, 63% 
of businesses have difficulty knowing where to start when implementing AI technologies (Seagate 
2018). The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that businesses have the knowledge, tools, 
talent and support to capitalise on AI’s potential. It has included a series of new measures in this Action 
Plan to support this. 

Our Action Plan will support those businesses starting out in AI, and it will also support our advanced 
manufacturing sectors. Enabling digital technologies, such as AI, will help our manufacturers to create 
entirely new products, processes and business models. The use of AI is likely to have significant benefits 
to each of our 6 National Manufacturing Priorities under our Modern Manufacturing Strategy. Evidence 
of AI’s application is already seen among the industries included in the manufacturing priorities. 

These measures build on a range of other measures already driving adoption of technology in Australia. 
These other measures include those with a technology focus, as well as broader settings, including 
getting our tax settings right.

Australia’s AI Action PlanActions

 AI DIRECT MEASURES

The Australian Government will provide $53.8 million to establish a National AI Centre within CSIRO’s 
Data61, as well as 4 AI and Digital Capability Centres (Capability Centres). The National AI Centre will 
coordinate Australia’s AI expertise and capabilities. It will also address barriers that small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) face in adopting and developing AI and emerging technologies. The Capability 
Centres will help SMEs to adopt AI by providing access to cutting edge AI technology and experts. SMEs 
will connect with AI practitioners, access AI tools and facilities, and benefit from services and training 
to help them confidently adopt AI. This initiative will make it easier for these businesses to innovate 
and remain competitive. It also complements the broad range of targeted, government-funded support 
available to SMEs. 

The Australian Government will provide $12 million to establish the Catalysing the AI Opportunity in 
our Regions program. This program will co-fund competitive grants to deploy AI in regional areas and 
support participation by diverse cohorts. These projects will help build awareness of AI applications 
to regional challenges and ensure that the benefits are spread evenly around Australia. Crucially, this 
program will build regional communities’ trust in AI technologies. It will ensure that the design and 
implementation of responsible AI technologies reflects the values of both urban and rural Australia.

The Cooperative Research Centres Projects (CRC-P) program provides funding for short-term research 
collaborations to develop new products, services or technologies (including AI). The projects facilitate 
industry-research collaboration that delivers real outcomes, benefits SMEs and provides education and 
training activities. Since 2018, the CRC-P program has provided $43.7 million to support 21 industry-
led AI-focussed projects. For example, the CRC-P program has helped Australian company, Seeing 
Machines, in partnership with Monash University, Ron Finemore Transport and Volvo Australia to 
develop computer vision technology. This technology helps prevent driver fatigue and helps monitor 
drivers for the commercial transport sector.

 DRIVING THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND 

DIGITAL SKILLS

The Australian Government’s $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy is funding projects that will 
transform manufacturing businesses. This strategy will help businesses to scale up, translate ideas into 
commercial successes, and integrate into local and international value chains.

An expanded Digital Solutions – Australian Small Business Advisory Services will invest $12.7 million to 
provide 17,000 small businesses access to high quality, low cost and independent advice to adopt digital 
technologies. This measure also includes funds to conduct a pilot to provide services to select not-for-
profit organisations. 

The Digital Business-to-Business (B2B) Partnerships Initiative will leverage the trusted relationships 
that Australia’s corporate sector has with SMEs to promote the adoption of and access to digital 
products and services. This initiative was announced as part of the Digital Economy Strategy.

The Digital Foundations for Agriculture Strategy, under the National Agricultural Innovation Agenda, 
will help promote AI in Australia’s agriculture and Agtech industries. Together with the new priorities set 
out in the National Agricultural Innovation Policy Statement, the strategy sets out a pathway for driving 
development and widespread uptake of digital technologies including AI.

Australia’s AI Action Plan FOUNDATIONAL POLICY SETTINGS

The Entrepreneurs’ Programme (EP) helps Australian businesses to grow, strengthen, innovate and 
commercialise both nationally and globally. The program provides businesses with access to expert 
advice and financial support that will take them to the next level, including assisting businesses to 
digitise their operations. For example, FluroSat received an Accelerating Commercialisation Grant from 
EP which helped it commercialise a platform. The platform combines machine learning, agricultural 
modelling and remote sensing imagery (from drones, planes and satellites) to detect early signs of 
plant stress. The platform is helping crop agronomists and farmers make better-informed decisions 
and improve crop yields by 10–25%. 

The Research and Development Tax Incentive (R&DTI) reduces R&D costs by offering generous tax 
offsets for companies conducting eligible R&D activities. The program aims to encourage companies 
to invest more in these activities to generate benefits for the broader Australian economy. The R&DTI 
provides over $2.5 billion to over 11,000 businesses every year. The Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) field of research comprises around 40% of all R&DTI registrations across all sectors. 
However, not all software development meets the requirements of the program. This has led technology 
sector stakeholders to seek greater clarity around how the R&DTI applies to their activities. To address 
these concerns, the Australian Government is working with technology sector representatives to 
improve guidance, including through consultation on new software specific guidance material.

The Tax incentives for early stage investors provide tax concessions to investors in qualifying Early 
Stage Innovation Companies. These investors will often bring business experience to the business in 
addition to capital. 

The Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnerships (ESVCLP) and Venture Capital Limited 
Partnerships (VCLP) programs are designed to increase venture capital investment in Australia.  
The ESVCLP program aims to increase investment in startups through Australian early stage venture 
capital funds by providing tax offsets and capital gains tax exemptions on eligible investments.  
The VCLP program is also aimed at increasing investment through Australia’s venture capital sector  
by providing tax concessions to eligible foreign investors.

The Australian Government is also allowing taxpayers to self-assess the effective life of depreciating 
intangible assets such as patents, registered designs, copyright and in-house software for tax purposes.  
This change reduces the cost of investment for business and aligns the tax treatment of these intangible 
assets with the treatment of tangible assets.

Australia’s AI Action PlanFOCUS TWO: CREATING AN 
ENVIRONMENT TO GROW AND 
ATTRACT THE WORLD’S BEST AI 
TALENT

Ensuring that Australian businesses have 
access to world-class talent 
Australia has produced some of the world’s finest AI minds and is an attractive destination for global AI 
talent. To remain competitive and realise the benefits of an AI-economy, our workforce must constantly 
retool and reskill (RMIT 2021).

Technological change is creating new types of job opportunities. From 2014 to 2019, emerging 
professions associated with data and AI grew faster than other types of professions in 20 major 
economies, including Australia (Figure 1). Shortage of high-end AI talent is one of the most pressing 
challenges for businesses looking to deploy AI technologies (Silverpond 2019). The CSIRO’s Data61 
estimates that industry will need up to 161,000 additional AI specialist workers by 2030 (Hajkowicz et al. 
2019:iv). 

Preparing our existing workforce and society for an AI-enabled economy requires a system-wide 
approach. This is why the Australian Government is taking meaningful steps to help ensure all 
Australians have the skills to engage with the digital economy and are ready for the jobs of the future. 
The Australian Government’s investment starts in schools and carries through to on-the-job training, 
and is being advanced through a raft of different initiatives. It recognises both the hard and soft skills 
necessary to participate in a digital economy and required in the development of AI.

 AI DIRECT MEASURES

The Next Generation AI Graduates program will provide $24.7 million to increase Australia’s specialist 
AI talent through targeted scholarships. It will address industry skills shortages and train diverse cohorts 
of AI students on industry projects desired and needed by industry.

Since 2018, more than $200 million has been awarded by the Australian Research Council on projects, 
linkages and fellowships that involve AI. In particular, the ARC Linkage Program promotes national 
and international research partnerships between researchers and business, industry, community 
organisations and other publicly funded research agencies. The research projects funded through this 
program encourage the transfer of skills, knowledge and ideas as a basis for securing commercial and 
other benefits of research. Grant opportunities are made available through a number of schemes under 
the Linkage Program. Funding is awarded to support the highest quality applied research through 
national competition across all disciplines. 

In October 2020, the Australian Government committed $20 million to establish the Centre for 
Augmented Reasoning at the University of Adelaide. The centre will support Advanced Reasoning 
research through PhD scholarships and will increase AI literacy and engagement in Australia.

 DRIVING THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND 

DIGITAL SKILLS

The Next Generation Emerging Technology Graduates Program will provide $22.6 million to deliver more 
than 200 competitive national scholarships in emerging technologies to meet our advanced technology 
needs. This initiative will build on and complement the new Next Generation AI Graduates program.

The Digital Skills Cadetship Trial is providing $10.7 million to support innovative trials of cadetships for 
digital careers to increase the number of Australians with high-level digital skills. This aims to deliver 
digital skills in a more flexible and timely way through a 4–6 month cadetship comprising formal 
training with on-the-job learning.

Additional funding of $43.8 million is being provided to expand the Cyber Security Skills Partnership 
Innovation Fund. The fund is for industry and education providers to deliver more projects that meet 
local requirements to quickly improve the quality and quantity of cyber security professionals in 
Australia. The fund builds on the broader Cyber Security Strategy 2020. This strategy is creating a more 
secure online world for Australians, our businesses and the essential services upon which we all depend. 
It included an initial $26.5 million for the Cyber Security Skills Partnerships Innovation Fund. 

The Foundation Skills for Your Future Program – Digital Project Rounds is providing $5 million to 
prioritise projects with a digital skills focus to improve foundational skills for employed or recently 
unemployed Australians. The program supports Australians who need flexible training in reading, 
writing, maths, English language and digital skills.

15

Australia’s AI Action Plan FOUNDATIONAL POLICY SETTINGS

The Australian Government is providing $5.8 million to scope a University Research Commercialisation 
Scheme to better translate and commercialise university research outputs. The scoping study will develop 
options for the establishment of the scheme, drawing on advice from universities, industry and other experts.

The Global Business and Talent Attraction Taskforce is actively targeting exceptional global talent. 
This includes academics, researchers and experts at the top of their field who can drive innovation in 
future-focused industries to come to Australia and develop their ideas here. The initiative aims to fill 
critical skills gaps and bring new technologies, cutting edge research and development, as well as IP 
and capital to our shores.

The government’s demand-driven skills system is supporting Australians to acquire the skills and 
training they need to meet the needs of the modern Australian workplace. The Job Ready Graduates 
package and JobTrainer Fund are ensuring Australians can skill up for their future. They are also 
ensuring we build the right mix of skills needed to enable business to adopt and develop emerging 
technologies. The Job-Ready Graduates package is delivering more job-ready graduates in the 
disciplines and regions where they are needed most. The package is helping to drive the nation’s 
economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The JobTrainer Fund is providing additional training 
places in areas of identified skills need such as health, aged and disability care, IT and trades for job 
seekers and young people, including school leavers.

The Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy is supporting businesses and Group 
Training Organisations to take on new apprentices and trainees to build a pipeline of skilled workers to 
support sustained economic recovery. As part of this measure, the Australian Apprenticeship Support 
Network will deliver additional Gateway Service places and enhanced In-Training Support for women 
interested in, or starting, an apprenticeship in a non-traditional trade occupation.

Australia’s AI Action PlanFOCUS THREE: USING CUTTING 
EDGE AI TECHNOLOGIES TO 
SOLVE AUSTRALIA’S NATIONAL 
CHALLENGES

Delivering the benefits of AI to all 
Australians
AI-powered solutions can help overcome some of our nation’s greatest challenges. The CSIRO’s Data61 
outlined how AI can help lower energy costs, improve health outcomes and protect our environment 
(Hajkowicz et al. 2019). New measures in this action plan will help to unlock these opportunities.

We have strong foundations to support our AI ambition. Australia possesses world-leading capabilities 
in AI research. As shown on Figure 3, Australian AI publications are being cited more than the world 
average. We can leverage our world-leading capabilities to build competitive advantage. The CSIRO’s 
Data61 enables collaboration between a global network of partners in government, industry and 
academia with an applied R&D focus in data science and engineering. 

The Australian Government is committed to supporting a respected and coordinated AI ecosystem. 
One that can translate Australia’s capabilities and strengths into real-world solutions and create new 
opportunities for commercialisation and export (Industry Innovation and Science Australia 2021). 
Australia is already a leader in AI research, placing third in the world (following Singapore and Hong 
Kong, respectively) according to peer-reviewed AI publications, when citation impact is field-weighted 
(Figure 3; Zhang et al. 2021:24). A coordinated AI system will help Australia realise this competitive 
advantage, and turn that into commercial ideas, economic growth, jobs, and a better world.

 AI DIRECT MEASURES

The Australian Government will provide $33.7 million to establish the AI Solutions to Build a Stronger 
Australia program. This program will work in partnership with industry to leverage private expertise to 
solve national challenges. We will jointly develop and deploy AI-enabled solutions to address economic, 
health, social, infrastructure and environmental challenges of national scale.

The CSIRO’s Machine Learning and AI Future Science Platform is exploring questions such as how 
we can provide explainable AI for decision-making to protect the Great Barrier Reef. The Future 
Science Platforms are an investment in frontier science that underpin innovation with the potential to 
help reinvent and create new industries for Australia. These multidisciplinary investments are turning 
challenges into opportunities where innovative science and technology is breaking through seemingly 
impossible problems to improve Australia’s prosperity and sustainability. 

The Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) is a long-term investment supporting Australian health 
and medical research. The MRFF aims to transform health and medical research and innovation to 
improve lives, build the economy and contribute to health system sustainability. Through the MRFF, the 
Australian Government awarded $19 million in transformative medical research projects using AI. This 
included projects using AI to:

  improve mental health treatments for Australians

  understand and optimise treatments for stress, anxiety and depression

  understand the vital interventions or components of therapies and why they are effective for some 

patients and not others. 

Invest in Defence AI – The Department of Defence is coordinating research and investment in AI 
capabilities to strengthen capability across the information and cyber, maritime, air, space and land 
domains. This includes a $10 million initiative to support Australian industry to develop AI applications 
for intelligence mission data, and virtual reality and graphics applications.

 DRIVING THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND 

DIGITAL SKILLS

The National Digital Health Strategy sets the direction for the digital health system. It supports national 
coordination, investment and collaboration in national health information and systems development. 
The aim of the strategy is to achieve better health for all Australians. This will be enabled by seamless, 
safe, secure digital health services and technologies that provide a range of innovative, easy to use tools 
for both patients and providers.

The Business Research and Innovation Initiative (BRII) aims to drive innovation that addresses 
Australian Government policy and service delivery challenges, with the help of startups and SMEs. 
The BRII challenges are set by different government agencies and have covered topics ranging across 
biosecurity, child protection, water markets and policy design.

 FOUNDATIONAL POLICY SETTINGS

The Digital Atlas of Australia will bring together crucial datasets, allowing us to draw unique insights 
into the Australian economy. By combining a range of sources including infrastructure, environment, 
health and employment datasets, this national platform will facilitate new, detailed analyses of 
Australia’s demographics.

18

Australia’s AI Action PlanFOCUS FOUR: MAKING 
AUSTRALIA A GLOBAL 
LEADER IN RESPONSIBLE AND 
INCLUSIVE AI 

AI needs to be built to reflect the values of 
the Australian community
The Australian Government recognises that to reap the benefits of AI it is vital that all Australians, from 
businesses to consumers, have trust in the technology. Australians need to be able to trust that the 
technology will be used responsibly and safely, and that AI promotes and improves inclusivity. As shown 
in Figure 3, while public acceptance of AI is trending positively, there is still a significant proportion 
of Australians who are hesitant about these new technologies (Lockey et al. 2020). Unless negative 
outcomes are minimised, lack of trust in AI technology will continue to be a major barrier to adopting 
and applying AI. 

The Australian Government released the AI Ethics Framework in 2019 to guide businesses and governments 
developing and implementing AI in Australia. The framework includes 8 AI ethics principles to:

  help reduce the risk of negative impacts from AI

  ensure the use of AI is supported by good governance standards.

The AI Ethics Framework affirms our commitment to the OECD Principles on AI – to promote AI that 
is innovative, trustworthy and that respects human rights and democratic values. The release of the AI 
Ethics Framework also reflects our decision to become a founding member of the Global Partnership 
on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI). Widespread adoption of the framework’s principles among business, 
government and academia will build trust in AI systems. 

Government can also support businesses, consumers and the broader public to have the confidence to 
actively participate in the digital economy. It can do this by providing regulation that is clear, proportionate 
and fit-for-purpose. The Australian Government is undertaking a range of initiatives that review existing 
regulations and develop meaningful guidance on the sharing and use of data. These include: 

  reviewing the Privacy Act 1988 to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose in the context of more personal 

information about individuals being captured and processed

  delivering the forthcoming Australian Data Strategy to set out the government’s objectives on 

enabling safe and secure data use across the economy

  setting standards for the safe and transparent sharing of public sector data, as authorised under 

the Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020. 

The National Cabinet also agreed to develop an intergovernmental data-sharing agreement to ensure 
jurisdictions can capitalise on the value of public data to achieve better outcomes for Australians. 

The government will also consider the recently completed report of the Australian Human Rights 
Commission into Human Rights and Technology, which considered the human rights implications of 
new technology.

To be a global leader in AI, it is also important that all Australians have the opportunity to be involved. 
The Australian Government recognises the need for this effort to be inclusive. For example, women 
made up just 19% of domestic ICT enrolments in 2019 (DESE 2020). A diverse and inclusive AI workforce 
will mean that Australia is better able to benefit from varied approaches to problem solving (UNESCO 
2020). It will promote Australia as a destination for responsible and ethical AI. As such, the government 
continues to promote avenues to increase the diversity and representation in the AI workforce. The 
government’s Next Generation Women in STEM measure will provide scholarships for women studying 
STEM courses, including AI. This measure builds on other initiatives the government has undertaken to 
increase the proportion of women in STEM professions and studies. 

19

Australia’s AI Action PlanAustralia’s trade links with neighbouring countries are a major factor in our economic success, and 
there are rapidly increasing digital export opportunities in the region. International cooperation plays 
an important role in shaping technology standards, norms and ethics in line with our values. Building on 
partnerships and collaborations will help grow international trust in Australian AI products. These will 
also ensure our interests are supported through our involvement in international standard setting. 

This leadership will ensure that as we develop our AI capability, it will align with our values. It will also 
ensure all Australians share the opportunities and benefits.

 AI DIRECT MEASURES

Progress the implementation of Australia’s AI Ethics Principles – Some Australian Public Service (APS) 
agencies are already considering the AI ethics principles when applying AI. In addition, the Australian 
Government will publish case studies from its pilot of the principles with industry. The case studies will 
share lessons learnt to help other businesses to apply the principles and to inspire more businesses to 
do this. The businesses that participated in the pilot were Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Flamingo 
AI, Insurance Australia Group, Microsoft, the National Australia Bank and Telstra. 

Continue to support Australia’s AI values internationally – The Australian Government will continue 
to ensure that Australia is represented internationally in multilateral and multi-stakeholder forums and 
processes. This includes:

  our representation on the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI)

  standards setting

  through our wider implementation of the International Cyber and Critical Technology Engagement 

Strategy. 

These processes can shape global standards, including ethical principles and frameworks on AI in ways 
that are consistent with Australian values.

Promote the benefits of AI through engagement with business and the Australian public – 
The Australian Government will continue to engage and have transparent and open conversations 
around the use of AI. Forums, such as Techtonic, will provide mechanisms where the benefits and uses 
of AI can be promoted and shared.

20

Australia’s AI Action Plan 
 DRIVING THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND 

DIGITAL SKILLS

The review of the Privacy Act 1988 will ensure that its privacy settings empower consumers to protect 
their data and best serve the Australian economy. The review is part of the government’s response to 
the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Digital Platforms Inquiry. The review seeks to:

  bring Australia’s privacy laws into the digital era

  strengthen privacy protections for individuals

  streamline compliance for businesses working across international borders. 

The appropriate settings for the safe and transparent sharing of public sector data will be established 
and authorised under the Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Bill 2020. The DAT Bill will modernise 
government data sharing and use. It will improve how the Australian Government shares and uses its 
data to benefit Australians through more effective policies, programs, and improve service delivery and 
research outcomes. The DAT Bill will also enable greater sharing of government data with researchers 
and businesses for the purposes of improving policy, program and research and development outcomes. 

The Boosting Female Founders Initiative supports startups founded by women to grow and scale into 
domestic and global markets by providing access to early stage capital. The program also provides 
expert mentoring and advice to applicants. This in turn boosts the economy by increasing the diversity 
of startup founders.

The Boosting the Next Generation of Women in STEM program is providing $42.4 million to support up 
to 500 industry co-funded scholarships for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
(STEM) disciplines. Women are significantly underrepresented in STEM education. The scholarships will:

  support women to build the cross-cutting and multi-disciplinary skillsets sought by industry

  foster the next wave of mentors and role-models

  support women to re-tool and re-enter the workforce.

 FOUNDATIONAL POLICY SETTINGS

The Australian Data Strategy will outline a clear vision for maximising data-driven innovation across 
the economy by improving access to data, data sharing arrangements, data asset management and 
strengthening collaboration on data. This will provide greater access to uniquely Australian datasets and 
ensure that AI technologies are optimised for use in the Australian context.

The Consumer Data Right gives consumers greater access to and control over their data. By improving 
consumers’ ability to compare and switch between products and services, it encourages competition 
between service providers and drives innovation. 

21

Australia’s AI Action PlanDIRECT AI 2021–22 BUDGET 
MEASURES: IMPLEMENTATION 
AND NEXT STEPS

The AI Action Plan includes a targeted $124.1 million Australian Government investment to strengthen 
Australian leadership in developing and adopting responsible AI. 

It leverages our competitive strengths, drives technological transformation and economic growth while 
ensuring all Australians have an opportunity to benefit from AI. This will increase the productivity and 
competitiveness of Australian businesses and create new, high-paying jobs. 

The plan will support Australian businesses to operate at the digital frontier, enter new markets and 
scale their operations. Globally, it will help position Australia to be a leading digital economy and 
society by 2030.

Our future pathways for success will depend on government, industry, researchers and civil society 
working together across the ecosystem. Where possible, we will measure our progress and report on 
implementation of the action plan each year. 

22

Australia’s AI Action PlanNational Artificial Intelligence Centre
Establishing the National AI Centre alongside 4 Digital Capability Centres (Capability Centres) 
will lay the foundations for an Australian AI and digital ecosystem. These centres will help drive 
business adoption and the use of transformative AI technologies to improve productivity and lift 
competitiveness.

The National AI Centre (within CSIRO’s Data61) will coordinate Australia’s AI expertise and capabilities. 
It will address barriers that SMEs face in adopting and developing AI and emerging technology. 
The centre will also:

  support projects that lift AI business capability to use cutting edge technology across 

multiple sectors

  foster collaboration between industry and researchers and attract investment

  work across the entire AI ecosystem to ensure that activities delivered by each of the 

Capability Centres are strategically aligned

Four Capability Centres will be appointed through an open competitive process that will focus 
on specific applications of AI, such as robotics or AI-assisted manufacturing. These centres will provide:

  a ‘front door’ for SMEs looking for talent, knowledge and the tools to adopt transformational 

AI technologies

  access to advice and training to help SMEs confidently adopt AI technologies

  links with the required AI expertise to identify business needs and connect SMEs to 

leading researchers.

A key focus of this measure will be increasing commercialisation of Australia’s AI expertise and 
capabilities. This will require collaboration between research organisations, businesses and industry 
to create a thriving digital ecosystem.

The program will be open for applications in coming months.

Australia’s AI Action PlanCatalysing the AI Opportunity in our Regions
The Catalysing the AI Opportunity in our Regions grants program will incentivise AI practitioners to 
engage with regional businesses to develop AI solutions for regional problems. Providing opportunities 
to build greater awareness of the benefits of AI throughout regional communities is a step towards:

  supporting trusted, safe and secure online interactions

  increasing the regional opportunities that AI technologies offer. 

This measure will support businesses that operate in regional Australia. It can potentially benefit those 
in key manufacturing industries, such as those included in the National Manufacturing Priorities under 
our Modern Manufacturing Strategy.

The program will consist of 3 rounds with up to 12 co-funded competitive grants per round, delivered 
on a rolling basis every 12 months. Successful applicants will receive competitive, cofunded grants of 
$250,000 to $1,000,000. Joint applicants will be invited to apply – for example, a joint application with 
regional businesses and research institution partners. Applicants can include universities and publicly 
funded research bodies, technology companies and regional businesses, including SMEs and startups.

Australia’s AI Action PlanNext Generation AI Graduates
The Next Generation AI Graduates Program will attract and train at least 234 home-grown, job-ready 
AI specialists through competitive national scholarships. 

The scholarships will be co-funded with universities and industry to support students to pursue 
an Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) Levels 8 (Honours) to 10 (Doctoral) qualification. 
Students will also participate in tailored training and professional development to build job-ready and 
complementary skills. These graduates will help backfill the shortage of AI specialists, which businesses 
report as the most pressing challenge to adapting and developing AI technologies. 

The Next Generation AI Graduate program is designed so that cohorts of high-performing students 
undertake industry-focused research projects and placements to build real-world experience. This 
will bridge the research-industry divide by focusing research on industry-specific topics, translating 
research directly into industry and developing students with industry-ready experience. This would be 
expected to include experience in key sectors where Australia has a comparative advantage, including 
the 6 National Manufacturing Priorities under the Modern Manufacturing Strategy.

In addition to the AI Action Plan initiatives, a further investment in the Next Generation Emerging 
Technology Graduates Program will attract and train a further 234 specialists through competitive 
national scholarships. The specialists will be in other emerging technologies, such as robotics, cyber 
security, quantum computing, blockchain and data. 

By increasing the supply of job-ready AI specialists, business will be better placed to adopt, adapt and 
deploy new and emerging technologies. Access to this pipeline of home-grown AI talent will:

  help drive the competitiveness of Australian businesses

  ensure local talent is available to fill high-skilled AI jobs here in Australia.

This complements efforts of the Global Business and Talent Attraction Taskforce to generate quality jobs 
for Australians and work with businesses to build clusters of skills in priority sectors.

CSIRO will deliver the Next Generation AI Graduate program. It will work with universities, industry 
partners and other stakeholders in the development and implementation of this measure. The measure 
will include mechanisms that best ensure Australia retains students onshore following the completion of 
their studies.

Australia’s AI Action PlanAI Solutions to build a stronger Australia
AI Solutions to Build a Stronger Australia will support businesses to partner with government to pilot 
AI projects that address challenges of national significance. These businesses will develop AI-based 
solutions to these challenges that will lead to job creation, economic recovery and other social benefits.

Challenges will focus on areas of AI specialisation identified in the Artificial Intelligence Roadmap, 
National Science and Research Priorities, CSIRO Missions, and areas supporting the Modern 
Manufacturing Strategy. These challenges will combine private sector expertise and government data to 
solve challenges that tangibly improve the lives of Australians. 

This initiative will also provide a pathway to enable agencies to procure the AI solution at the end of the 
pilot to address the national challenge. Participating businesses will retain the intellectual property of 
their solutions, providing them with an opportunity to commercialise their work.

This measure will be delivered through a challenge-based competitive grants process. In each round of 
the program, challenges will be put forward by the Australian Government. Those that believe they can 
provide a solution to the challenge will have the opportunity to submit a proposal for consideration by 
government. It will be expected that any grantees will abide by Australian principles and legislation on 
privacy, data sharing and other relevant requirements. Grantees are also expected to adopt Australia’s 
AI Ethics Principles in their solutions.

Developing AI-based solutions will also provide an opportunity to demonstrate the application and 
potential of AI technologies, encouraging greater adoption across the economy.
