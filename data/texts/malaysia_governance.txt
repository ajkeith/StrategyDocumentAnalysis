building for THE  FUTURE
Malaysia is a trading nation. As a trading nation it is imperative for 

Malaysia to continuously seek to grow the market for the products 
it produces.

Already  at  the  global  front,  the  manufacturing  sector  is  reimagining  the 
future  of  manufacturing  where  conventional  models  are  making  way  for 
greater technology adoption and the key determinants are efficiency, speed 
and flexibility towards sustaining competitiveness. 

While Malaysia is abundant with natural resources, it is the manufacturing 
sector that has played a key role in turning Malaysia into a major player 
in  the  global  value  chain  apart  from  rapidly  turning  the  country  into  an 
industrialised nation.

In recent decades, the manufacturing sector has seen rapid evolution. From 
mass production through the use of intensive labour force in production 
lines,  to  the  use  of  robotics  to  increase  efficiency,  the  manufacturing 
industry is constantly evolving with more and more infusion of automation. 
Today, the next phase of evolution is referred to as the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution or Industry 4.0. 

The term itself may seem meaningless as revolution is tied to evolution, 
a dynamic ongoing process of improvement. But technology, without the 
knowledge of application will not contribute to improvement.

Therein  lies  the  substance  in  the  term  Fourth  Industrial  Revolution. 
Essentially  what  it  entails  is  infusing  higher  value-added  process  of 
manufacturing through the application of advanced digitisation, advanced 
manufacturing technologies and efficient resource utilisation.

This  would  result  in  enhanced  efficiency  and  reduced  dependency  of 
human labour and ultimately driving competitiveness going forward. 

In  Malaysia,  there  is  a  clarion  call  for  the  manufacturing  sector  to  shift 
to  higher  value-added  process,  digitisation,  advanced  manufacturing 
technologies  and  efficient  resource  utilisation  to  drive  competitiveness 
going forward. 

A  strong  manufacturing  sector  would  pave  the  way  to  enhanced 
productivity, job creation, innovation capacity, high-skilled talent pool and 
ultimately economic prosperity and societal well-being. This would position 
Malaysia  as  a  primary  destination  for  smart  manufacturing  globally  and 
attract more high-tech investments.

I believe that this can all be achieved through the Industry4WRD: National 
Policy  on  Industry  4.0,  which  would  enable  the  manufacturing  sector  to 
move into Industry 4.0 and along the way contribute to fulfilling Malaysia’s 
commitment to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

I would like to express my appreciation to all parties who have provided 
their  valuable  input  and  support  towards  formulating  this  Policy.  I  look 
forward  to  all  stakeholders  combining  strengths  to  realise  the  future 
competitiveness of the Malaysian manufacturing sector. 

Let  us  embrace  change,  collaborate,  innovate  and  transform  to  create 
value and impact. 

Will this be disruptive to the way we are used to doing things? Again, the 
substance  lies  in  the  application  of  available  technology. We  have  seen 
how application of information technology and the internet of things have 
opened up market supply chains easing access to produce from the most 
remote of areas, bringing wealth and prosperity to the rural areas.

Thank you.

Industry  4.0  could  address  many 

Likewise, 
issues  concerning 
manufacturing  with  regard  to  i.e.  hazardous  environments,  health  and 
safety  of  human  labour,  efficiency  in  managing  supply  chains,  reduction 
in  wastages,  savings  in  time  with  efficient  management  of  delivery 
systems. The potential for growth is simply limitless, but it all boils down to 
knowledge in application.

clarion call  FOR  ACTION
The Fourth Industrial Revolution was the centrepiece of conversations 

at  the  World  Economic  Forum  (WEF)  on  ASEAN  in  Kuala  Lumpur, 
Malaysia in June 2016, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in May 2017 and 
in Hanoi, Vietnam in September 2018. Numerous forums have heaped on 
the  trend  and  discussions  have  been  concentrating  on  how  the  Fourth 
Industrial Revolution would impact the businesses and the entire society 
at large.

While some would look at this as a potentially massive opportunity, there 
are concerns among the majority of firms and industry sectors as to how 
the  Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  would  transform  both  the  products  and 
services that will be offered, and the processes or business models that 
are used to generate them.  The Government, business firms and academia 
are now looking at how best to react towards this trend. 

With this in mind, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has taken 
the proactive measure to develop this National Policy on Industry 4.0, with 
the objective of transforming the Malaysian manufacturing industry and its 
related services to be smart, systematic and resilient. 

Although  this  Policy  is  designed  for  the  manufacturing  industry  and  its 
related services, the strategies are also applicable and could be replicated 
in other industries as well, albeit with different sets of priorities and action 
plans. 

I  am  heartened  to  note  that  within  the  Government,  the  support  and 
cooperation  given  have  been  overwhelming  where 
the  Technical 
Working  Groups  (TWGs)  headed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of 
Communications & Multimedia, Ministry of Education, Ministry of  Human 
Resources,  Ministry  of  Energy,  Science,  Technology,  Environment  and 
Climate Change and SME Corp. have worked tirelessly to provide inputs 
throughout  the  development  of  this  Policy.  Extensive  consultations  were 
also undertaken with the industry and other stakeholders.

Various initiatives supporting the implementation of this Policy have already 
been announced.  Hence, by the time this publication is in your hand, some 
of the action plans would have already been rolled out. 

The key to moving forward is to collaborate.

The  goal  for  the  future  of  manufacturing  industry  is  not  only  to  “make 
better  things”  by  creating  innovative  products  and  services,  but  also  to 
“make things better,” by improving design, engineering, service planning 
and execution, management and production processes.

Therefore,  I  am  taking  this  opportunity  to  call  on  all  stakeholders  to 
view  this  Policy  objectively  and  work  together  with  the  Government  to 
deliver the strategies and action plans towards strengthening Malaysia’s 
competitiveness in the long run.

The  overarching  philosophy  behind  this  Policy  is A-C-T  - Attract,  Create 
and Transform. 

• Attract stakeholders to Industry 4.0 technologies & processes;
•  Create the right ecosystem for Industry 4.0 technologies to be adopted 

and to nurture innovations; and

•  Transform  capabilities  of 

the  manufacturing 

industry 

to  be 

Industry 4.0-ready.

landscape  calls 

This Policy, in essence, outlines 13 broad strategies for Malaysia to embark 
on  a  journey  that  will  transform  the  manufacturing  industry  landscape 
over the next decade. MITI believes that this journey towards Industry 4.0 
adoption is anchored on three shift factors: People, Process and Technology.

People: putting people and the entire organisation as a priority. This Policy 
focuses  on  strategies  towards  creating  differentiated  talent  acquisition, 
developing the required human capital and retaining our existing talents by 
providing them with the right support. 

Process: improving the manufacturing and the whole business processes 
by  encouraging  smart  and  strategic  public-private  partnerships.  We 
remain  committed  to  ensuring  the  manufacturing  sector  continues  to 
contribute significantly to the nation’s economic prosperity. To propel this 
further,  we  are  working  towards  improving  the  business  environment  to 
reform unfavourable or overly-bureaucratic policies, attracting high value 
investments  for  greater  economic  development  and  strengthening  the 
overall infrastructure for the manufacturing sector, while seeking greater 
partnerships with the industry. 

technologies  are 
Technology:  advancement  and  convergence  of 
increasingly  underpinning  global  manufacturing  competitiveness.  We 
acknowledge  that  many  leading  manufacturing  firms  have  started  to 
adopt  and  implement  smart  manufacturing  solutions  where  advanced 
hardware are now combined with advanced software, sensors as well as 
data analytics. This move has resulted in smarter products, processes, and 
more  closely  connected  customers  and  suppliers  along  the  firms’  value 

We would also like to see greater leverage on the strength of ecosystem 
partnerships  beyond 
traditional  manufacturing  boundaries.  These 
strategies which are aimed at embracing a broader ecosystem approach 
as well as developing and taking advantage of integrated manufacturing 
and  technology  clusters  and  partners,  are  key  determinants  in  moving 
forward.  We  need  to  develop  a  balanced  approach  across  the  whole 
ecosystem  as  increasingly  sophisticated  tools  and  strategies  will  be 
required to optimise the manufacturing industry from talent, technological, 
operational, financial, tax and regulatory perspectives.

This Policy is not a panacea to all issues surrounding the industry. What 
we are hopeful for is for it to provide the basis and support for firms to 
do things differently in order to stay competitive. For that to happen, the 
Government  hopes  that  the  Policy  would  serve  as  the  impetus  for  our 
industry to make the leap into Industry 4.0.

GLOBAL
OVERVIEW

THE 
INEVITABLE 
TRANSFORMATION

The world is currently amidst a technological transformation that will fundamentally 
change  the  way  we  live  and  work.  It  is  difficult  to  predict  precisely  how  this 
transformation will impact different industries and countries. However, we know that 
this transformation is unlike anything we have seen before due to the sheer pace and 
breadth of these changes. 

Many see these changes as an ushering of new era of growth, change and opportunity. 
The ramification it brings for manufacturing firms is forcing nations and governments 
to re-evaluate how the manufacturing industry operates and contributes to economic 
growth. Nations are now increasing their focus on developing advanced manufacturing 
capabilities by investing in high-tech infrastructure and quality education. These are 
done  by  facilitating  the  transformation  of  the  manufacturing  industry  to  the  next 
technology frontier and raising their economic wellbeing. 

The  First  Industrial  Revolution  started  with  the  advent  of  steam  and  water  power, 
enabling  mechanisation  of  production  processes,  while  the  Second  Industrial 
Revolution  was  driven  by  electric  power  and  mass  manufacturing  techniques. 
Information technology and automation brought in the Third Industrial Revolution. The 
Fourth Industrial Revolution is exploding on the back of a range of technologies that 
are blurring the distinction among physical, digital and biological spaces.

Industry 4.0 transforms how products are designed, fabricated, used and operated as 
well as how they are maintained and serviced. It will also transform the operations, 
processes, supply chain management and energy footprint of factories.

13

Industry  4.0  changes  the  global  landscape of  manufacturing competition,  reducing 
the  relative  competitive  advantage  of  low-cost  regions  that  rely  on  cheap  labour. 
Nations  and  manufacturing  firms  that  lead  in  embracing  Industry  4.0  technologies 
and  processes  will  gain  over  global  competitors.  This  competitiveness  hinges  on 
the  ability  to  transform  by  responding  to  market  shifts  and  technology  trends. The 

transformation of the manufacturing industry, through Industry 4.0, 
is also in line with  the United Nation’s Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), especially in support of Goal #9 and Goal #12.

GOAL #9

Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialisation and 
foster innovation. Inclusive and sustainable industrial development is the 
primary source of income generation, allows for rapid and sustained 
increases in living standards for all people, and provides the 
technological solutions to environmentally sound industrialisation. 
Without technology and innovation, industrialisation will not happen, and 
without industrialisation, development will not happen.

Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Sustainable 
consumption and production is about promoting resource and energy 
efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic 
services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. Its 
implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce 
future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic 
competitiveness and reduce poverty.

GOAL #12

14

Industry4wrd : National Policy on Industry 4.0

GLOBAL
OVERVIEW

DRIVEN  BY 
multiple factors

The  manufacturing  industry  is  increasingly  shifting  towards  producing  more 
technologically-complex products. 

It is no longer enough for the manufacturing industry to make better things - creating 
innovative products and services that will meet customer needs - but also to make 
things  better  -  facilitating  the  design  engineering,  service  planning  and  execution 
as  well  as  improving  the  management  and  production  processes.  Furthermore, 
despite  steady  improvements  in  the  manufacturing  output  and  employment  in  the 
sector, renewed investments will be needed to build the necessary infrastructure and 
increase resources to support the continuous growth.

This emphasis on “making better things while making things better” is driven by the 
following factors: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Shifts in the global economic order - the rise of China, economic realignment 
due to changes in the developed world, and the rise of fast-growth emerging 
economies; 

Rate of technology advancement and its convergence - technological changes 
driven by applications of these technologies in the manufacturing industry, such 
as big data, the Internet of Things and cloud computing; 

Knowledge  and  skills  for  the  future  -  retaining  talent  and  producing  future 
workforce by taking advantage of the opportunities of this transformation;

Global  supply  chain  dynamics  –  increasing  complexity  in  the  supply  chain 
networks  caused  by  distributed  sourcing,  engineering  and  production  as 
manufacturing firms now manage partners in a borderless world not bound by 
geographical locations;

15

• 

• 

Competitiveness of nations and firms - greater global competition as firms must 
defend their domestic markets while simultaneously tapping into new market 
segments for long-term growth; 

• 

Changing  customer  behaviour  –  influenced  by  values, 
personalisation  and  customisation,  and  the  emergence  of 
new products and services attributes that are forcing firms 
to reassess their manufacturing systems.

Increased  regulations  -  environmental  concerns  and  standards-based  factors 
like ISO compliance that apply across an increasingly interconnected world; and

GLOBAL
OVERVIEW

ADVANCEMENT 
and Convergence of Technologies

Many of these technologies have been around or under 
development  for  several years.  However,  the  interaction 
and  resulting  convergence  of  these  technologies  is 
creating  an  unprecedented  pace  and  breadth  of 
impact. Completely new industries may be created at 
these intersections. Thus, these are loosely termed as 
Industry 4.0 technologies. Given below is an overview 
of these technologies and their impact on manufacturing. 
By no means is this list exhaustive or definitive. 

At the heart of Industry 4.0 is a set of rapidly evolving 
and  converging  technologies. These  are  pushing  the 
boundaries  of  what  can  be  manufactured  through 
additive manufacturing and advanced materials. These 
technologies  are  enabling  richer  insights  through  big 
data  analytics.  They  are  blurring  the  lines  between 
physical  and  digital  realms  through  rich  simulations 
and  augmented  reality.  They  are  enhancing  human 
capacity through artificial intelligence and autonomous 
robots.  We  are  also  seeing  a  shift  in  the  way 
information  technology  is  being  used  through  cloud 
computing,  system  integration  and  the  Internet  of 
Things (IoT).  Last but not least, cybersecurity plays an 
important  role  in  ensuring  information  systems  and 
manufacturing  lines  are  protected  from  cybercrime 
threats.

Additive manufacturing is 
advancing with the use of 
new materials, opening 
completely new possibilities. 
For example, 3D printing of 
organic tissues has created 
opportunities for growing live 
organs. It is revolutionising 
traditional production, aided 
by a recent surge in metal 
additive printing.

AI is a concept that is made up 
of numerous subfields such as 
machine learning, which 
focuses on the development of 
programs that can teach 
themselves to learn, understand, 
reason, plan and act when 
exposed to new data in the right 
quantities. AI technology will 
supplement the smart factory 
towards networked factory, in 
which data from supply chains, 
design teams, production lines 
and quality control are linked to 
form a highly integrated and 
intelligent engines.

Increasingly big data techniques 
are being applied in 
manufacturing industry to 
improve customer experience 
and product quality, realise 
energy efficiency and conduct 
predictive maintenance. It is 
now possible to collect masses 
of data from several different 
sources to direct decisions that 
anticipate product or equipment 
failure.

New materials and 
nano-structures are being 
developed, allowing for 
beneficial material properties, 
e.g. shape retention and 
thermoelectric efficiency. 
Together with additive 
manufacturing technologies, it 
will allow for massive 
customisation and development 
of products that were not 
possible until now.

The industrial communication is 
expanding and strongly 
connected, as such, digital 
security becomes a critical 
aspect that must not be 
overlooked in the industrial 
environment. It has now 
become more complex as it 
consists of connected devices 
and environments that cannot 
be protected by traditional 
cybersecurity approaches. 
Current cybersecurity has 
largely been developed for 
IT-centric devices and 
environments.

While many engineers 
are already familiar with 
simulations in the field of 
product design, the 
advent of augmented 
reality, AI and big data is 
expected to take 
simulations to the next 
level. It will be possible to 
simulate manufacturing 
processes using different 
production settings to 
find the optimal way to 
manufacture a product. 
Simulations can also be 
used to test product 
usage under different 
operating environment 
using different types of 
materials.

Past industrial revolutions 
required significant 
capital as a ticket for 
entry. With cloud 
computing, many of the 
Industry 4.0 technologies 
can be made available to 
even smaller companies 
as a utility with minimal 
upfront capital 
investment. Companies 
can leverage 
cloud-based product 
design, simulation, AI and 
big data solutions to 
improve their production 
processes and build 
products better suited for 
their customers.

While the initial 
augmented reality 
technologies are still in 
nascent stages, they are 
advancing at a rapid 
pace. Some of the first 
applications can be 
found in the delivery of 
information and training, 
e.g. augmented reality 
can be used to deliver 
part replacement 
instructions to 
maintenance staff in the 
field.

Industry 3.0 brought in 
an era of computing and 
interconnectedness but it 
often relied on humans to 
make even the most 
trivial decisions. Industry 
4.0 technologies embody 
an unprecedented 
proliferation of sensors 
and connectedness 
among these sensors. 
Combined with other 
technologies such as AI 
and big data, it is now 
possible to envisage 
entirely autonomous 
systems that 
revolutionise 
manufacturing.

Machinery and robots are 
transformed towards 
their next generation. 
Robots can do more on 
their own, including 
learning on the job and 
teaming up with other 
robots and humans. This 
technology allows 
systems to think, act and 
react autonomously as 
well as conduct remote 
decision making. This 
can help contribute to a 
company’s 
competitiveness, 
productivity and 
profitability.

System integration 
occurs in vertical (within 
the industry value chain) 
and in horizontal systems 
(across multiple value 
chains), eventually 
achieving end-to-end 
digital integration across 
the entire value chain.

Industry4wrd : National Policy on Industry 4.0

GLOBAL
OVERVIEW

COMPETITIVE  RESPONSE 
by Nations & Lessons LearnT

Recognising the importance of the transformation of the manufacturing industry to their industrial future state, many countries 
have launched Industry 4.0 related policies and programmes to support the research, development and deployment of Industry 
4.0 technologies and processes at their local manufacturers.

Several of the global and leading manufacturing countries have already embarked on their Industry 4.0 transformation and are in advanced stages of implementation, e.g. 

Germany, the US, the UK, China and Republic of Korea. It is critical for Malaysia to learn from these experiences and move fast in its own Industry 4.0 adoption to not fall 

behind in its global manufacturing position.

We can draw the 

following lessons 

from the 

experiences of 

other countries in 

charting the 

transformation to 

Industry 4.0:

Set high aspirations: Setting right aspirations is critical to drive outcomes. 

Policymakers should have clear, actionable, targeted and impactful objectives 

for Industry 4.0 strategy. This helps bring the right attention and act as an 

inspiration for the country.

Ensure the right level of focus: With such ambitious nationwide programmes,

it is easy to get too narrowly focused on a few sub-sectors on one hand or being too

broad on the other. Balanced coverage of sectors and technologies is critical. At the policy 

level, the focus should be on building an enabling environment to encourage innovation 

and adoption in priority sectors. 

Pay attention to enablers: Enablers such as infrastructure, funding, skills and 

technology create a fertile ground to encourage innovation and kickstart a virtuous, 

self-sustaining ecosystem. Policymakers need to tailor emphasis to the current

realities of their country.

Include SMEs: Industry 4.0 technologies present both opportunities and risks for SMEs.  

Thus, an inclusive programme is required to ensure that SMEs can make the 

transformation to more advanced manufacturing processes or risk being left behind. More 

importantly, Industry 4.0 provides an opportunity for the small companies of today to 

become giants of tomorrow.

Provide access to funding: Availability of capital and incentives from the beginning 

ensures that Industry 4.0 programmes have a solid start in the country. Funding and 

incentives should be directed towards both R&D and adoption of these technologies in the  

manufacturing process.

Implement from the top: Industry 4.0 is expected to have far reaching impact

across industries, societies and the broader economy. Thus, it is not a domain of any one 

Government department or agency. Governance for such initiatives should be initiated at 

the top most level in the country, with emphasis on strong cross-ministerial and agency 

collaboration.

IMPORTANCE  OF  THE 
Manufacturing Sector in Malaysia

The Malaysian manufacturing industry is an important economic sector contributing 
about 22% to the GDP in the last five years. To date, its growth has had the effect 
of  stimulating  jobs,  attracting  investments  and  creating  business  opportunities  in 
the  downstream  activities  and  related  services  sectors.  The  manufacturing  sector 
is expected to remain resilient and is on track to achieve the targeted annual GDP 
growth rate of 5.1% under the 11th Malaysia Plan (RMK-11).

It is important to note that the sector is made up of a large number of SMEs, which 
account  for  98.5%  of  the  manufacturing  firms.  Although  most  of  these  SMEs  do 
not have a strong global presence, many have the potential to be global exporters. 
Together with other ongoing initiatives like the eCommerce Strategic Roadmap and 
the  Digital  Free-Trade  Zone  (DFTZ),  the  Government  is  trying  to  provide  the  right 
platform  for  SMEs  to  reinvent  themselves  and  adopt  the  latest  technologies  to  be 
globally competitive. 

On  a  global  level,  Malaysia  has  been  enjoying  a  fairly  strong  and  competitive 
position in both manufacturing and the use of technology. The Global Manufacturing 
Competitiveness Index 2016 (by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) ranked Malaysia at 17th 
place among 40 countries. The report also projected Malaysia to climb four notches to 
13th by 2020. On the technology and innovation side, the Global Innovation Index 2017 
(by Cornell University, INSEAD and WIPO) ranked Malaysia at 37th globally among 127 
countries and 8th in Asia. Further, the recent Readiness for the Future of Production 
Report 2018 (by WEF and A.T. Kearney) highlights that Malaysia is well-positioned to 
benefit from the future of Industry 4.0.

NEED  TO  EMBRACE  
Industry 4.0

Despite  its  strong  current  position,  the  state  of  the  manufacturing  industry  has 
been  a  case  for  concern  in  the  last  few  years.  Malaysia  has  moved  away  from 
being an investment destination for low cost labour manufacturing activities and is 
challenged by lower cost competitors from emerging economies and rapidly changing 
technologies.

In  line  with  the  global  trends  outlined  before,  three  major  factors  are  impacting 
the future of manufacturing in Malaysia, offering opportunities for growth, but also 
challenging its competitive position:

• 

• 

• 

Global  value  chains  and  geographies  of  production  are  continuing  to  shift, 
especially as China and other Northeast Asian countries are relocating production 
to ASEAN. This is opening up new opportunities for Malaysia. However, Malaysia 
will need to transform itself fast as other countries in the region are catching up.

Quality  of  labour  and  higher  productivity,  and  not  low  labour  cost,  will  be 
the  new  source  of  competitive  advantage.  Although  Malaysia’s  labour 
productivity  has  grown  at  3-4%  over  the  last  few  years,  its  relative 
global  position  and  use  of  high-skilled  labour  have  not  moved  forward. 
Malaysia’s  labour  productivity  was  ranked  only  at  44th  position  in  2016,  a 
position  that  has  remained  unchanged  since  2009.  The  relative  share  of 
high-skilled labour declined from 19% in 2010 to 18% in 2017.

New  technologies  are  disrupting  and  fostering  a  technology-based  model 
of  production.  Barriers  of  adoption  have  come  down  with  key  Industry  4.0 
technologies  maturing  and  costs  declining.  Application  of  technologies  to 
improve efficiency and product quality is becoming the new normal, requiring 
Malaysian manufacturing firms to innovate and invest in new technologies to 
remain competitive.

27

This will require a new and comprehensive policy framework that 
guides  the  transformation,  systematically  addresses  potential 
barriers  and  fosters  urgency  and  action  across  the  industry  and 
all other stakeholders.

As  such,  it  is  imperative  for  Malaysia  to  transform  itself  at  an  accelerated  pace 
and embrace Industry 4.0 as a critical cornerstone to propel and sustain its future 
manufacturing  competitiveness.  Specific  attention  needs  to  be  given  to  four 
overarching goals:
• 
• 
• 
• 

Drive continuous growth in manufacturing GDP;
Increase national productivity;
Create higher skill employment opportunities; and
Raise innovation capabilities and competitiveness.

PROPELLING 
SMEs Forward 

In Malaysia’s transformation, particular attention needs to be given to SMEs 
as  they  account  for  the  bulk  of  manufacturing  companies  (98.5%)  and  a 
major part of employment (42%). 

While  most  of  the  large  manufacturing  firms  are  already  anticipating  the 
benefits and risks of adopting Industry 4.0 practices, Malaysian SMEs appear 
to be cautious in taking the leap. Despite the enormous economic potential of 
Industry 4.0, SMEs in the industry remain relatively unaware about it. There is a 
risk that Malaysian SMEs might be left behind.

Industry  4.0  has  the  potential  to  transform  manufacturing  SMEs  in  multiple 
ways:  improving  productivity,  efficiency  and  cost;  enhancing  organisational, 
management and production capabilities; enabling better quality and monitoring; 
and developing innovators and producers of Industry 4.0 technologies.

The  level  of  transformation  required  is,  however,  very  substantial  for  SMEs.  It  will 
not  just  be  about  adopting  Industry  4.0  technologies,  but  also  about  changing 
business  processes  and  operating  models.  For  example,  SMEs  will  need  to 
collaborate and participate in broader production networks with other  SMEs, large 
firms  or  multinational  corporations.  Digitalisation  of  the  manufacturing  system  will 
be  important  to  build  direct  links  to  end  customers  and  produce  innovative  and 
customised products. 

Scale  effects  are  also  being  redefined  as  SMEs  are  making  headways  in  many 
markets and outperforming larger corporations due to their agility and adaptability.  
As such, manufacturing SMEs will need to learn how to deal with these disruptions, be 
more resilient and embrace the change as an opportunity.

SMEs stand to gain the most from this Policy. The aim is to optimise the framework 
conditions and support structures accordingly, so that manufacturing SMEs will be 
able to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0 and take full advantage of the benefits and 
opportunities it presents.

MALAYSIA’S  READINESS   
for Industry 4.0

A key question is how ready Malaysia is for Industry 4.0. The recent report on the Readiness for the Future of Production Report 2018, jointly published by 
the World Economic Forum (WEF) and A.T. Kearney, provides a global assessment of 100 countries and positions Malaysia in the “Leader” quadrant. These 
are countries with a “strong current production base” and who are “positioned well for the future”. It is also interesting to note that Malaysia and China are 
the only two non-high income countries in the “Leader” quadrant.

This is both an enviable and a challenging position for Malaysia. On the one hand, it underscores Malaysia’s strong current manufacturing position and 
its readiness for Industry 4.0. On the other hand, it also highlights the economic value at stake if Malaysia is not able to transform itself in an accelerated 
manner. The gap to global leaders like Japan, Republic of Korea, Germany, Switzerland and China is still significant and other countries in the region have 
aggressive plans and are moving fast in their implementation.

WEF’s analysis identifies technology, human capital, global trade and networks, and institutional frameworks as key drivers of production for Industry 4.0. 
Malaysia’s ranking in each of these drivers emphasises priorities in technology, human capital and institutional frameworks (21st to 30th position out of 100 
countries), consistent with some of the challenges highlighted previously: 

29

Technology adoption and diffusion are particularly important for SMEs and underscore 
the importance of creating production networks and collaborations with MNCs and large 
companies.

Human capital focus is key to creating an accelerated shift in productivity, especially as 
Malaysia has been relying on low labour cost in the past, with a declining share of 
skilled labour.

Strengthening institutional frameworks underpins the role of Government in creating the 
right ecosystem and facilitating collaborative platforms.

On global trade and investment, Malaysia is already well-integrated into regional value 
chains and exhibits a very good trade infrastructure, which is reflected in its strong 
global ranking (7th).

Industry4wrd : National Policy on Industry 4.0

CASE  FOR
ACTION

MALAYSIA 
moving forward…

From the stakeholder interactions and issue analyses, five themes emerge that drive 
the  development  of  an  end-to-end  Industry  4.0  ecosystem  in  Malaysia. They  have 
also  been  guiding  the  development  of  this  National  Policy  on  Industry  4.0  and  the 
four key goals of GDP contribution, national productivity, high-skilled employment and 
innovation capabilities.

Upskilling and reskilling existing and future 
labour pool need to be at the heart of Malaysia’s 
transformation

Inclusive involvement of SMEs is critical to 
power a holistic step up in labour productivity across the 
economy

Significant evolution in innovation 
capabilities and collaborative platforms is essential to 
foster the development of, and access to, cost-effective 
technologies that address specific sector needs 

Focused funding support is needed to kickstart 
the adoption and complement private sector investments

Good digital infrastructure is required to enable 
reliable and secure Industry 4.0 operations

POLICY 
Objectives

Already,  a  number  of  initiatives  and  organisations  have  been  established  at 
national, state and regional levels by both the Government and industry to develop 
action  plans  to  strengthen  the  manufacturing  industry. This  support  for,  and  focus 
on,  manufacturing  firms  are  important.  However,  these  initiatives  have  largely 
been  developed  independently  and  often  have  overlapping  objectives  and  industry 
audiences.

There is a need for a more streamlined and cohesive national agenda under which these 
initiatives and organisations can be integrated to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation 
into a smart and modern manufacturing system. This will also include the need for 
a  greater  alignment  across  Government,  research  and  academia  regarding  priority 
industries, specific goals, enabling actions, and their funding. Countries like Germany 
and  Japan  provide  examples  of  best  practices  where  Government,  research  and 
academia are tightly integrated with the manufacturing industry through collaborative 
public-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  that  develop  innovative  solutions  for  specific 
industry needs.

With  this  in  mind,  Malaysia  has  put  in  place  the  National  Policy  on  Industry  4.0  – 
Industry4WRD – that provides a concerted and comprehensive transformation agenda 
for the manufacturing sector and its related services.

Infrastructure

Funding & Outcome-based Incentives

The development and adoption of Industry 4.0 
technologies and processes may require 
substantial investments by manufacturing 
firms. Questions will arise on what incentives 
and funding options are available by both 
Government agencies and private entities, 
especially for SMEs. 

The funding strategies are aimed at 
encouraging companies to adopt new 
manufacturing technologies and processes 
and invest in R&D, specifically to develop 
local solutions targeted at Malaysia’s needs 
and priorities. Special attention will be given 
to collaborative efforts in developing and 
deploying Industry 4.0 technologies. 

To ensure progress and impact, the incentives 
will be linked to specific outcomes.
These strategies are applicable to both 
manufacturing firms as the users and 
adopters, and to service providers of Industry 
4.0 technologies and solutions. 

Enabling Ecosystem & Efficient Digital 
Infrastructure

Fast and secure data connection is a basic 
requirement for the realisation of Industry 4.0. 
Good and reliable internet speed rate is needed 
for implementing internet-based production 
technologies or services, be it IoT solutions, use 
of augmented reality and wearables in 
production or the evaluation of real-time data. 
Although Malaysia has deployed High Speed 
Broadband and 4G technologies on a 
widespread basis, there are still some gaps in 
key industrial and training locations.

A digitalised and connected infrastructure across 
supply and manufacturing value chains is critical 
to foster a seamless movement of goods, data 
and services; drive efficiency and resource 
optimisation and support joint development 
efforts. Currently, a number of processes are still 
not digitalised across many ministries and 
Government agencies, ranging from various 
approvals, licensing, certification, to clearance of 
goods and other processes.

Service providers will play an essential role in 
helping Malaysian companies accelerate their 
transition to Industry 4.0, particularly in 
developing people, transforming processes and 
adopting technologies. As such, involving service 
providers and linking them to manufacturing 
firms, especially SMEs, is important to create a 
holistic and effective Industry 4.0 ecosystem.

and improve productivity.

Finally, developing and commercialising new 
technologies and processes that address 
specific needs in priority sectors will be 
crucial to retain Malaysia’s position as a 
preferred high-tech and manufacturing hub, 
and supply chain partner.

IMPLEMENTATION  APPROACH

The strategies and 
action plans outlined 
in this Policy require  
collaborative efforts 
across multiple 
stakeholders and 
organisations.
To accelerate or 
improve the intended 
outcome of these 
actions, a number of 
factors must be 
taken into 
consideration to 
identify the most 
efficient and 
effective 
implementation 
approach. This 
includes but not 
limited to: 

Not a one-stop 
solution 
Although efforts
have been taken to 
incorporate all possible 
interventions, this Policy 
is not a solution to all.

Multi-ministries 
jurisdictions 
The strategies and 
action plans in this 
Policy form a 
systemic solution for 
the manufacturing 
industry and its 
related services.

One size fits all – breadth and depth 
This Policy provides broad strategies and action 
plans. It is premised upon the principle that each 
sector within the manufacturing industry has 
different levels of readiness in embracing and 
adopting Industry 4.0. Further work is required 
to customise these recommendations for each 
sector depending on their needs and priorities.

Differentiating circumstances

In recognising the best practices among manufacturing 

ecosystems such as Germany and Japan, it is acknowledged 

that the needs and the driving factors of these countries are 

very much different from Malaysia’s. An exact replication of 

their successful systems would not work well in Malaysia’s 

context due to these differences. As such, each manufacturing 

sub-sector needs to consider which elements of these 

international benchmarks could be adopted.

Solutions for SMEs 

Majority of the manufacturing firms are SMEs. They typically have lower 

levels of collaboration in research, limited access to high performing 

graduates and lack of capital to invest in strategic planning.  However, the 

agility and specialisation of SMEs will be critical in achieving the 8-year vision 

for the manufacturing sector. In implementing the suggested actions, it is 

important to ensure solutions are accessible and effective for SMEs, and that 

the research community and larger businesses are more incentivised to 

collaborate with SMEs.

Transforming Malaysian manufacturing sector is not a short-term 

process, where many industries having experienced significant 

challenges for decades. A supportive policy environment is required 

over the next decade to provide businesses with stability and allow 

them to execute these long-term strategies.
