                           Singapore has a unique opportunity to harness digital disruption and propel ourselves onto a new 
                           growth trajectory to sustain our future national competitiveness and improve the lives of Singaporeans. 
                           We have made good progress through our Smart Nation movement, and have put in place the data and 
                           digital infrastructure to accelerate our whole-of-nation drive to transform our Government, economy, 
                           and society.
                           Artiffcial Intelligence (AI) represents the next frontier of technological opportunities. Often, the 
                           bottleneck to reaping the full beneffts of AI is not in the readiness of the technology, but in our ability 
                           to redesign processes, systems, and regulation to deploy them. Singapore is well-positioned to do this 
                           at a national scale. We have made signiffcant and early investments into AI research and are recognised 
                           as a global thought leader in AI ethics and governance. We are a global hub for digital and AI talent, 
                           with a vibrant tech startup ecosystem and a highly educated workforce that understands the value and 
                           potential of technology. Most importantly, we are able to bring Government, industry, and researchers 
                           together to work together on deploying AI solutions to address key national priorities.
                           Vision
                           The National AI Strategy is a living document to place Singapore at the forefront in the development 
                           and deployment of scalable, impactful AI solutions, in sectors of high value and relevance to our 
                           citizens and businesses. 
                           • Singapore will be a global hub for developing, test-bedding, deploying, and scaling AI solutions.

                           • Government and businesses will use AI to generate economic gains and improve lives. AI will raise 
                            the Government’s capability to deliver anticipatory and personalised services, and will also be a 
                            strong driver of growth in key sectors of Singapore’s economy.
                           • Singaporeans will understand AI technologies and the beneffts it can bring; our workforce will
                            be equipped with the necessary competencies to participate in the AI economy.
                           To achieve this, we will focus on delivering National AI Projects and strengthening our

       and economic value for its citizens. Societies that cannot adapt will fall behind.                                  to transform our Government, economy and society. The build-up of our digital capabilities and 
                                                                                     infrastructure has given us a running start in developing and deploying AI. 
       The rise of applicable, deployable AI represents a golden opportunity for Singapore to open new

   We will focus on driving AI deployment in key sectors with high social or economic value for Singapore, 
   and for which we can build on existing strengths.
   We have identiffed nine such sectors: Transport & Logistics, Manufacturing, Finance, Safety & Security, 
   Cybersecurity, Smart Cities & Estates, Healthcare, Education and Government.                                                                                         A*STAR’s Human-Centric AI R&D programme

   The National AI Strategy consists of two components: 
   National AI Projects
   We will progressively identify National AI Projects in key sectors of high social and/or economic impact, 
   and apply the AI deployment loop from problem deffnition to deployment. These projects will guide 
   investment in AI research, generate lead demand to anchor talent and capabilities in Singapore,
   and guide how Singapore builds up its supporting digital infrastructure. 
   In Section 3, we have sketched out a portfolio of 5 National AI Projects in the areas of transport
   and logistics, smart cities and estates, healthcare, education and safety and security. Beyond these
   ffve projects, we will continue to identify future projects of similar impact level to pursue within
   the key sectors.
    
   AI Ecosystem Enablers
   The National AI Projects will generate momentum for AI deployment and demonstrate the value of AI. 
   To enjoy sustained beneffts from AI, we will strengthen ecosystem enablers that drive AI innovation 
   and adoption across the economy. In Section 4, we explain our plans to build up 5 critical ecosystem 
   enablers: Triple Helix Partnership, AI Talent and Education, Data Architecture, Progressive and Trusted 
   Environment, and International Collaboration.  3 NATIONALAI PROJECTS

   The 5 National AI Projects address key national challenges for 
   Singapore in transport and logistics, smart cities and estates, 
   healthcare, education, and safety and security. Implementing them 
   will require our research institutes, industry, and Government to 
   work collectively to develop and deploy AI solutions.   1. INTELLIGENT

       Companies must develop the organisational capacity to deploy AI solutions if they are to realise the 
       full, transformative value that the technology can bring to their businesses. This requires investing in 
       digital infrastructure and engineering capabilities, as well as fostering an innovative culture. To assist 
       companies in doing so, Singapore will make more resources available for them to adopt AI solutions 
       and develop AI-related applications:

       • Industry digital transformation and AI deployment plans. As part of the SMEs Go Digital programme, 
         SMEs can leverage the sector-speciffc Industry Digital Plans, which provide a step-by-step guide on 
         the digital solutions to adopt at each stage of a company’s growth. The programme aims to curate 
         more AI-enabled solutions to benefft businesses in various industries as they embark on their
         digital transformation journey. 

       • AI Singapore’s 100 Experiments programme. The 100 Experiments (100E) programme supports 
         companies in deploying AI in a co-investment model by providing them with access to talent from  
         AISG’s AI Apprenticeship Programme. AISG has undertaken more than 38 AI projects with company 
         partners, of which 10 have had AI deployed into production.

       • The AI Makerspace is a new national platform developed by AI Singapore to support SMEs and 
         start-ups to jumpstart their AI journey. It provides access to resources for AI experimentation such
         as off-the-shelf, pre-built AI solutions (‘Bricks’), curated datasets from industry and Government, 
         cutting-edge AI libraries and tools, and supercomputing resources. AI Makerspace will also aim to 
         grow local companies to be able to deliver these solutions to our SMEs over the next 2−3 years.          •  Accreditation@SGDigital and SG:D Spark programmes help companies identify and engage quality 
           Singapore-based AI solution providers and start-ups. These programmes give buyers the assurance 
           of reliable digital and AI solutions when working with these companies and startups, allowing for
           a more streamlined approach to integrating digital solutions. At the same time, both the 
           Accreditation@SGD and SG:D Spark programmes help grow and scale promising and innovative 
           Singapore-based startups and companies. 


         •  Through the Tech Depot on SME Portal, local SMEs can access “Ready-to-Go” AI solutions developed 
           by A*STAR to enhance their productivity and expand their business. Companies can also gain access 
           to a broader range of AI expertise in A*STAR to grow their own AI capabilities by leveraging A*STAR’s 
           T-UP programme. 


         •  IMDA’s Digital Services Lab provides a suite of tools to help companies develop AI solutions and 
           leverage AI technologies. This includes the National Speech Corpus and the Intelligent Sensing 
           Toolbox. This suite of tools, developed to address the needs in the services sectors, is continually 
           being expanded and is made easily accessible for companies through platforms such as the

     Data is the foundation that anchors AI collaboration between Government, industry, and research.                  Trusted Data Sharing Framework
     Despite Singapore’s small size, we have natural comparative advantages in data. We can leverage our 
     unique common identiffers to curate rich, cross-sectoral datasets. Our heterogeneous, multi-ethnic 
     population gives us an edge in developing exportable AI solutions in sectors such as healthcare, 
     because AI algorithms trained on Singapore’s population could potentially be scalable across Asia.

     Singapore’s key value proposition to global companies and talent lies in our ability to provide timely 
     and secure access to rich, high quality datasets. We must manage our data as strategic national assets 
     and establish an ecosystem to acquire, clean, fuse, and distribute data across the public and private 
     sectors. At the same time, we must proactively build institutional capabilities to manage and govern 
     data, to protect against cyberattacks, safeguard our citizens’ data privacy, and ensure that data is used 
     for the public good. We will continually study industry and global best practices to identify new and 
     innovative ways of safeguarding data, while facilitating its effective usage. This will include enhancing 
     our policies, legislation, technical safeguards, and organisational structures, as well as keeping abreast 
     of and adopting frontier data security technologies. 

     We will begin by consolidating the data assets required for each of the National AI Projects, and put in 
     place the necessary data sharing frameworks and legislation to enable companies to share and exploit 
     data securely.

     Key Thrust 3.1 Establish frameworks for public-private data collaboration

     We will enhance our regulatory and policy frameworks to provide greater clarity on the scope, 
     governance, and technical safeguards for data sharing across the public and private sectors.
     This will encourage organisations to share and use data more pervasively for legitimate use cases,
     and help anchor public-private data collaboration and innovation.          •  Public-Private Data Sharing Framework. As the nation’s custodian of personal and administrative 
           data, the Government holds a data resource that many companies ffnd valuable. The Government 
           can help drive cross-sectoral data sharing and innovation by curating, cleaning, and providing 
           the private sector with access to Government datasets. The envisaged Public-Private Data Sharing 
           Framework will facilitate the sharing of Government data with non-Government entities (NGEs) and 
           key commercial partners, by deffning the scope, type, granularity, and safeguards (people, process, 
           and technical) of Government data that can be shared with the private sector. As a start, we will work 
           closely with the domain agency leads to develop this Framework to support the implementation of 
           the National AI Projects. We will develop a similar framework for NGEs and companies to share
           data with Government agencies.


         Key Thrust 3.2 Establish trusted data intermediaries for public-private
         data exchange 


         The Government will identify organisations to serve as trusted data intermediaries for data fusion and 
         distribution. These trusted entities could be situated in either the private or public sector, depending 
         on the sector, type of data, and where the majority of data are sited. 


         •  Deffne and promulgate common data standards to ensure data interoperability. To facilitate data 
           fusion, the Government will work with companies in key sectors to deffne and promulgate a set of 
           common data standards for the sector (e.g. standards for health records across restructured 
           hospitals, private GPs and research institutes).  


         •  Curate and publish a meta-data catalogue of public-private datasets required to implement the 
           National AI Projects. We will also work with the trusted data intermediaries to deffne common data 
           standard and technical safeguards to anonymise, secure, and provide companies and researchers 
           with access to these data. This will help facilitate data discovery and anchor data and AI 
           collaboration between Government agencies, industry, and researchers.     ECOSYSTEM ENABLER 4                                               Singapore will also apply multidisciplinary and human-centered approaches to study the systemic

         The launch of the National AI Strategy is timely. In the near future, AI is likely to pervasively affect 
         and inffuence all aspects of our lives in many ways. As a society, we must be alive to its beneffts and 
         potential pitfalls. Trust is crucial to the adoption of AI, and building trust is a multi-stakeholder
         effort involving public, private and people sectors.
          
         Singapore has shown thought leadership in developing a human-centric approach to AI governance 
         that balances the need for innovation and consumer protection. Our voluntary Model AI Governance 
         Framework was the ffrst national framework in Asia that provides practical guidance to organisations
         on how to implement AI responsibly. This is just the start of a never ending journey. We need to 
         continue to identify and address the ethical concerns that AI brings. The Advisory Council on the
         Ethical Use of AI and Data fully supports this national effort to create an enabling environment
         for our businesses and citizens.                      BROUGHT TO YOU BY
